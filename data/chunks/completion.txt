I'm sorry for any confusion, but as an AI assistant, I don't have specific details about your particular washer dryer. However, I can provide some general guidance:

1. Maximum Load Capacity: This varies from one washer dryer model to another. Typically, standard washer dryers have a capacity of around 5kg to 12kg. You'll need to refer to your specific machine's user manual or label for the accurate maximum load capacity.

2. Loading a Duvet: To load a duvet into a washer dryer, ensure it is evenly spread out in the drum. Avoid overloading, as this could lead to poor washing results and potential damage to the machine.

3. Recommended Washing Cycle for a Duvet: Typically, duvets should be washed on a gentle or delicate cycle with low spin speed. Most washing machines have a 'bedding' or 'duvet' specific cycle.

4. Care Instructions: Always check the care label on your duvet before washing. In general, use a mild detergent and avoid bleach. Do not overload the machine and ensure the duvet is completely dry before using.

5. King Size Duvet: Whether a washer dryer can handle a king size duvet depends on its drum size. Generally, you would need a machine with a drum size of at least 9kg to 10kg to comfortably wash a king size duvet. 

Please refer to your specific washer dryer's user manual for more accurate information.
