 
  
Dear shareholders, colleagues, customers, and partners:  

We are living through a period of historic economic, societal, and geopolitical change. The world in 2022 looks nothing like 
the  world  in  2019.  As  I  write  this,  inflation  is  at  a  40-year  high,  supply  chains  are  stretched,  and  the  war  in  Ukraine  is 
ongoing.  At  the  same  time,  we  are  entering  a  technological  era  with  the  potential  to  power  awesome  advancements 
across  every  sector  of  our  economy  and  society.  As  the  world’s  largest  software  company,  this  places  us  at  a  historic 
intersection of opportunity and responsibility to the world around us.  

Our mission to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more has never been more 
urgent  or  more  necessary.  For  all  the  uncertainty  in  the  world,  one  thing  is  clear:  People  and  organizations  in  every 
industry  are  increasingly  looking  to  digital  technology  to  overcome  today’s  challenges  and  emerge  stronger.  And  no 
company is better positioned to help them than Microsoft.  

Every day this past fiscal year I have had the privilege to witness our customers use our platforms and tools to connect 
what technology can do with what the world needs it to do.  

Here are just a few examples:  

•  Ferrovial, which builds and  manages some of  the world’s busiest airports  and highways, is using our cloud 

infrastructure to build safer roads as it prepares for a future of autonomous transportation.  

•  Peace Parks Foundation, a nonprofit helping protect natural ecosystems in Southern Africa, is using Microsoft 
Dynamics 365 and Power BI to secure essential funding, as well as our Azure AI and IoT solutions to help 
rangers scale their park maintenance and wildlife crime prevention work.  

•  One of the world’s largest robotics companies, Kawasaki Heavy Industries, is using the breadth of our tools—
from Azure IoT and HoloLens—to create an industrial metaverse solution that brings its distributed workforce 
together with its network of connected equipment to improve productivity and keep employees safe.  

•  Globo, the  biggest  media  and TV company in Brazil, is using Power Platform to empower its employees to 

build their own solutions for everything from booking sets to setting schedules.  

•  And  Ørsted,  which  produces  a  quarter  of  the  world’s  wind  energy,  is  using  the  Microsoft  Intelligent  Data 

Platform to turn data from its offshore turbines into insights for predictive maintenance.  

Amid this dynamic environment, we delivered record results in fiscal year 2022: We reported $198 billion in revenue and 
$83 billion in operating income. And the Microsoft Cloud surpassed $100 billion in annualized revenue for the first time.  

OUR RESPONSIBILITY  

As a corporation, our purpose and actions must be aligned with addressing the world’s problems, not creating new ones. 
At our very core, we need to deliver innovation that helps drive broad economic growth. We, as a company, will do well 
when the world around us does well.  

That’s what I believe will lead to widespread human progress and ultimately improve the lives of everyone. There is no 
more powerful input than digital technology to drive the world’s economic output. This is the core thesis for our being as a 
company, but it’s  not enough. As we  drive global economic growth, we must also commit  to creating a more inclusive, 
equitable, sustainable, and trusted future.  

Support inclusive economic growth  

We  must  ensure  the  growth  we  drive  reaches  every  person,  organization,  community,  and  country.  This  starts  with 
increasing access to digital skills. This year alone, more than 23 million people accessed digital skills training as part of 
our global skills initiative.  

1 

But  skills  alone  aren’t  enough—we  need  to  help  people  better  prepare  for  and  connect  to  jobs.  That’s  why  we’ve 
committed to equip 10 million people from underserved communities with skills for jobs in the digital economy by 2025.  

One  area  of  digital  skills  has  become  especially  critical:  cybersecurity.  Cybersecurity  is  a  significant  threat  for 
governments,  businesses,  and  individuals  around  the  world,  yet  there  simply  aren’t  enough  people  with  cybersecurity 
skills to fill open jobs.  

To help address this, we’ve committed to skill and recruit 250,000 people into the US cybersecurity workforce by 2025—
especially those underrepresented in the field. And we’re helping an additional 24 countries with substantial cybersecurity 
workforce shortages close their gaps too.  

We also continue to deliver affordable, relevant cloud technology and industry-specific solutions to nonprofit organizations 
addressing the world’s most pressing issues. This year, we provided $3.2 billion in donated and discounted technology to 
302,000  nonprofits  serving  over  1.2 billion  people  globally.  And  earlier  this  month,  we  announced  that  Microsoft  will 
double the number of nonprofits we reach worldwide over the next five years.  

Protect fundamental rights  

We  unequivocally  support  the  fundamental  rights  of  people,  from  defending  democracy,  to  protecting  human  rights,  to 
addressing racial injustice and inequity. And, as people’s access to education, healthcare, jobs, and other critical services 
becomes  increasingly  dependent  on  technology,  it’s  clear  that  access  to  broadband  and  accessible  technology  is  also 
fundamental to building a more equitable future.  

Since 2017, we’ve helped more than 50 million people in unserved rural communities globally gain access to affordable 
broadband  coverage.  Building  on  our  work  in  eight  US  cities,  we’re  now  partnering  with  five  US  states  with  significant 
broadband  adoption  gaps  to  increase  access,  adoption,  and  equity.  And—given  the  importance  of  current  data  to 
broadband  planning—the  new  Microsoft  Digital  Equity  Dashboard  will  help  US  policymakers  and  communities  identify 
neighborhoods where funding and programmatic investment can achieve measurable impact.  

This year, we continued our journey to address racial injustice and inequity by increasing representation within Microsoft, 
engaging our ecosystem, and strengthening our communities.  

Across our ecosystem, we are more than 90% of the way toward our commitment to spend an incremental $500 million 
with  Black-  and  African  American-owned  suppliers.  We’ve  coordinated  over  80  justice  reform  partnerships  to  help  145 
communities  expand  access  to  data-driven  insights  that  advance  a  more  equitable  system  of  justice  and  public  safety. 
And we’ve expanded our Technology Education and Learning Support (TEALS) program to 290 high schools in cities with 
large Black and African American communities—to promote more equitable access to computer science education.  

Our  work  to  help  preserve,  protect,  and  advance  democracy  by  promoting  a  healthy  information  ecosystem  and 
safeguarding  electoral  processes  is  as  salient  as  ever  in  today’s  geopolitical  climate.  Our  AccountGuard  nation-state 
threat  notification  service  protects  more  than  4 million  accounts  of  election  officials,  human  rights  organizations, 
journalists, and other organizations. Our efforts to preserve and protect journalism in the United States and Mexico have 
been  extended  globally  through  new  partnerships  with  the  Thomson  Reuters  Foundation,  Report  for  the  World,  and 
others.  

This year, we responded to six humanitarian emergencies in five countries through donations, technology, services, and 
employee  giving.  As  of  July  2022,  we’ve  committed  $257 million  in  financial  and  technology  assistance  to  the  global 
response to the war in Ukraine, including support for government, businesses, nonprofits, and humanitarian assistance for 
refugees. And, through our AI for Humanitarian Action initiative, we’re  helping organizations harness  the power  of AI to 
improve their disaster preparedness, response, and recovery.  

Finally, we continued working toward our five-year commitment to bridge the disability  divide for the  more than  1 billion 
people around the world with disabilities, seeking to expand accessibility in technology, the workforce, and  

2 

  
workplace. As just one example of this work, use of our Office Accessibility Checker—our “spell check” for accessibility—
has  grown  by  9x  over  the  past  year.  And,  along  with  partner  companies,  we  launched  the  Neurodiversity  Career 
Connector, a jobs marketplace for neurodivergent job seekers. 

Create a sustainable future  

We must ensure that economic growth does not come at the expense of our planet. Addressing climate change requires 
swift,  collective  action  and  technical  innovation.  We’re  continuing  our  pursuit  of  our  own  ambitious  commitments  and 
helping others achieve their climate goals, aided by technology.  

In  March,  we  released  our  second  annual  sustainability  report,  sharing  our  progress,  challenges,  and  learnings  as  we 
pursue  our  commitments  to  become  carbon  negative,  water  positive,  and  zero  waste.  Although  we  continued  to  make 
progress  on  several  of  our  goals  with  an  overall  reduction  in  Scope  1  and  Scope  2  emissions,  our  Scope  3  emissions 
increased, due in large part to significant global datacenter expansions and the growth in Xbox sales and usage. Despite 
these increases, we remain dedicated to achieving a net-zero future. We recognize that progress won’t always be linear, 
and the rate at which we can implement emissions reductions is dependent on many factors that can fluctuate over time.  

On the path to becoming water  positive, we invested in 21 water replenishment projects that  are expected  to  generate 
over 1.3 million cubic meters of volumetric benefits in nine water basins around the world. Progress toward our zero waste 
commitment included diverting more than 15,200 metric tons of solid waste otherwise headed to landfills and incinerators, 
as well as launching new Circular Centers to increase reuse and reduce e-waste at our datacenters.  

We  contracted  to  protect  over  17,000  acres  of  land  (50%  more  than  the  land  we  use  to  operate),  thus  achieving  our 
commitment to protect more land than we use by 2025.  

And  with  Microsoft  Cloud  for  Sustainability,  we’re  expanding  our  work  to  help  customers  meet  their  ambitious 
sustainability goals by enabling them to better collect, track, and analyze the metrics of their sustainability strategy.  

Earn trust  

To drive positive impact and growth with technology, people need to be able to trust the technologies they use and the 
companies behind them. We are committed to earning trust—both trust in business model alignment with our customers 
and  partners,  and  trust  in  technology,  spanning  privacy,  security,  digital  safety,  the  responsible  use  of  AI,  and 
transparency.  

We’re dedicated to preserving our customers’ privacy and their ability to control their own data. We advocate for strong 
privacy  laws  that  require  companies,  including  ours,  to  be  accountable  and  responsible  in  their  collection  and  use  of 
personal  data.  That’s  why  we  supported  the  new  Trans-Atlantic  Data  Privacy  Framework  and  committed  to  meet  or 
exceed  all  the  requirements  it  outlines.  And  through  the  Microsoft  privacy  dashboard,  millions  of  people  each  year  can 
make meaningful choices about how their data is used.  

Security and digital safety  are foundational to trust in today’s complex threat landscape. We analyze 43 trillion  security 
signals daily and use the insights to inform increased protections. This year, we blocked 34.7 billion identity threats and 
37 billion  email  threats.  Over  the  past  four  years,  we’ve  sent  over  67,000  nation-state-related  threat  notifications  to 
customers to help them protect themselves from digital threats.  

This comprehensive capability has been critical during recent world events, including the war in Ukraine. Our efforts have 
involved  both  defending  key  infrastructure  in  the  country—including  assisting  with  the  detection  and  disruption  of 
cyberattacks  and  cyberinfluence  operations  and  evacuating  data  to  the  cloud—as  well  as  supporting  people, 
communities, and organizations on the ground as part of our humanitarian and disaster response.

Our commitment to responsibly develop and use technologies like AI is core to who we are. We put our commitment into 
practice, not only within Microsoft but by empowering our customers and partners to do the same and by advocating for 
policy  change.  We  released  our  Responsible  AI  Standard,  which  outlines  17  goals  aligned  to  our  six  AI  principles  and 
includes  tools  and  practices  to  support  them.  And  we  share  our  open-source  tools,  including  the  new  Responsible  AI 
Dashboard, to help developers building AI technologies identify and mitigate issues before deployment.  

Finally,  we  provide  clear  reporting  and  information  on  how  we  run  our  business  and  how  we  work  with  customers  and 
partners, delivering the transparency that is central to trust. Our annual Impact Summary shares more about our progress 
and learnings across these four commitments, and our Reports Hub provides detailed reports on our environmental data, 
our political activities, our workforce demographics, our human rights work, and more. 

We should all be proud of this work—and I am. But it’s easy to talk about what we’re doing well. As we look to the next 
year and beyond, we’ll continue to reflect on where the world needs us to do better.  

OUR OPPORTUNITY  

Now,  let  me  turn  to  how  we  are  positioned  to  capture  the  massive  opportunities  ahead.  Over  the  past  few  years,  I’ve 
written extensively about  digital transformation, but now  we need  to go beyond that to  deliver  on what I call the  “digital 
imperative.”  

Technology  is  a  deflationary  force  in  an  inflationary  economy.  Every  organization  in  every  industry  will  need  to  infuse 
technology  into  every  business  process  and  function  so  they  can  do  more  with  less.  It’s  what  I  believe  will  make  the 
difference between organizations that thrive and those that get left behind.  

In the coming years, technology as a percentage of GDP will double from 5% to 10% and beyond, as technology moves 
from  a  back-office  cost  center  to  a  defining  feature  of  every  product  and  service.  But  even  more  important  will  be 
technology’s  influence  on  the  other  90%  of  the  world’s  economy.  From  communications  and  commerce,  to  logistics, 
financial services, energy, healthcare, and entertainment, digital technology will power the entire global economy as every 
company becomes a software company in its own right.  

Across our customer solution areas, we are delivering powerful platforms, tools, and services that expand our opportunity 
to help  every organization in every industry  deliver on the digital imperative—with  a business model that is trusted and 
always aligned with their success.  

Apps and infrastructure  

We are building Azure as the world’s computer, with more than 60 datacenter regions—more than any other provider—
delivering  faster  access  to  cloud  services  while  addressing  critical  data  residency  requirements.  With  Azure  Arc,  we’re 
bringing Azure anywhere, meeting customers where they are and enabling them to run apps across on-premises, edge, or 
multicloud  environments.  And  we’re  extending  our  infrastructure  to  the  5G  network  edge  with  Azure  for  Operators, 
introducing new solutions to help telecom operators deliver ultra-low-latency services closer to end users.  

As the digital and physical worlds come together, we’re also leading in the industrial metaverse. From smart factories, to 
smart buildings, to smart cities, we’re helping organizations use Azure IoT, Azure Digital  Twins, and  Microsoft  Mesh to 
digitize people, places, and things, in order to visualize, simulate, and analyze any business process.  

Data and AI  

From  best-in-class  databases  and  analytics  to  data  governance,  we  have  the  most  comprehensive  data  stack  to  help 
every organization turn its data into predictive and analytical power. With our new Microsoft Intelligent Data  

4 

  
Platform, we are helping customers focus on creating value instead of integrating a fragmented data estate. Cosmos DB 
is  the  go-to  database  powering  the  world’s  most  demanding,  mission-critical  workloads,  at  any  scale.  With  Azure 
Synapse, we’re removing traditional barriers between enterprise data warehousing and big data analytics so anyone can 
collaborate,  build,  and  manage  analytics  solutions.  And  we’re  creating  an  entirely  new  market  category  with  Microsoft 
Purview, as we help organizations govern, protect, and manage their data estate across platforms and clouds.  

When it comes to AI, we’re seeing a paradigm shift as the world’s large AI models become platforms themselves. And we 
are helping organizations apply the world’s most advanced coding and language models to a variety of use cases, such 
as writing assistance, code generation, and reasoning over data with our new Azure OpenAI Service.  

Digital and app innovation  

We have the most popular developer tools for any cloud and any platform to help organizations modernize existing apps 
and  build  new  ones.  GitHub  is  the  most  complete  developer  platform  to  build,  scale,  and  deliver  secure  software.  This 
year, we introduced GitHub Copilot, a first-of-its-kind AI pair programmer, to help developers write better code faster. And 
organizations are increasingly turning to both Visual Studio and our Azure PaaS services to streamline development and 
create modern, more resilient cloud-native applications.  

Low-code/no-code tools are rapidly becoming a priority for every organization’s digital capability. With Power Platform, we 
are  helping  domain  experts  rapidly  drive  productivity  gains  when  it’s  never  been  more  important.  We  have  nearly 
25 million  monthly  active  users.  And  we’re  innovating  to  make  it  even  easier  for  teams  of  professional  and  citizen 
developers to automate workflows, create apps, build virtual agents, and analyze data.  

Business applications  

With  our  expanding  portfolio  of  business  applications,  we  are  helping  every  business  become  a  hyperconnected 
business—unifying  data,  process,  and  teams  across  the  organization.  New  Dynamics  365  Connected  Spaces  helps 
organizations across diverse industries—from real estate and retail, to factories and construction—manage their physical 
operations.  And  with  new  integrations  between  Dynamics  365  and  Teams,  we  are  creating  a  new  category  of 
collaborative applications that helps businesses surface data and insights right in the flow of work.  

Our  industry  clouds  bring  together  capabilities  across  the  Microsoft  Cloud  with  industry-specific  customizations  to  help 
organizations  improve  time  to  value,  increase  agility,  and  lower  costs.  We  completed  our  acquisition  of  Nuance 
Communications this year, adding new cloud and enterprise AI capabilities for healthcare, as well as other industries. And 
as sustainability becomes an existential priority not just for our society but for every organization, our new Microsoft Cloud 
for  Sustainability,  which  I  mentioned  earlier,  is  helping  our  customers  record,  report,  and  ultimately  reduce  their 
environmental impact.  

Modern work  

Hybrid  work  is  now  just  work.  Every  organization  is  looking  to  reconnect  and  reengage  the  workforce  at  home,  in  the 
office, and everywhere in between. Microsoft Teams is the most used and most advanced platform for work, surpassing 
270 million  monthly  active  users  this  year.  It’s  the  only  solution  with  meetings,  calls,  chat,  collaboration,  and  business 
process automation in one place.  

Teams Rooms is bringing Teams to a growing ecosystem of devices to help organizations rethink their approach to space 
and  help  employees  participate  fully  in  meetings  from  anywhere.  And  with  Microsoft  Viva,  we’re  building  an  employee 
experience platform that brings together communications, knowledge, learning, resources, and insights in the flow of work 
to empower employees and strengthen their connection to their company’s mission and culture.  

5 

Modern life  

The PC has never been more relevant to work, life, and play. This year, we launched Windows 11, the biggest update to 
our  operating  system  in  a  decade.  It  reimagines  everything  from  the  user  experience  to  the  store  to  help  people  and 
organizations  be  more  productive,  connected,  and  secure,  and  to  build  a  more  open  ecosystem  for  developers  and 
creators. There are now more than 1.4 billion monthly active devices running Windows 10 or Windows 11. We launched 
new  Surface  devices  to  support  every  person  and  work  style.  And  we  have  nearly  60 million  Microsoft  365 consumer 
subscriptions as we help people create, connect, and share wherever they go.  

Security  

Cybersecurity is the number one threat facing every business today. To keep our customers secure, we build security by 
design  into  every  product  we  sell,  and  we  deliver  end-to-end  solutions  spanning  security,  compliance,  identity,  device 
management, and privacy across clouds and platforms. We are the only cloud provider with multicloud protection for the 
industry’s  top  three  cloud  platforms.  Our  new  Entra  product  family  includes  tools  for  permissions  management,  identity 
governance,  and identity verification. And we  now offer  managed threat  detection and response with Microsoft  Security 
Experts.  

LinkedIn  

LinkedIn  has  become  mission  critical  to  connect  creators  with  their  communities,  job  seekers  with  jobs,  learners  with 
skills, and marketers with  buyers. LinkedIn now has  more than 850 million  members,  and  our Sales, Talent,  Marketing, 
and Premium Subscriptions lines of business have all surpassed $1 billion in annual revenue over the past 12 months.  

Search, advertising, and news  

When  it  comes  to  advertising,  we  are  creating  a  new  monetization  engine  for  the  web—an  alternative  that  offers 
marketers  and  publishers  more  long-term  viable  ad  solutions—while  upholding  consumer  privacy  and  strong  data 
governance.  We’re  focused  on  increasing  our  share  and  engagement  across  our  browser  Microsoft  Edge,  our  search 
engine Microsoft Bing, and our personalized content feed Microsoft Start.  

And with our acquisition of Xandr, we now power one of the largest marketplaces for premium advertising. Netflix chose 
us this summer as its exclusive technology and sales partner for its first ad-supported subscription offering, a validation of 
the differentiated value we provide to publishers looking for a flexible partner to build and innovate with them. I couldn’t be 
more excited about our expansive opportunity ahead in this space.  

Gaming  

The big bets we have made across content, community, and cloud over the past few years continue to pay off. We’ve sold 
more  Xbox  Series  S  and  Series  X  consoles  life-to-date  than  any  previous  generation  of  Xbox,  and  with  Xbox  Cloud 
Gaming, we’re bringing games to entirely new endpoints. In the past year, we’ve  made  many of  our most popular titles 
accessible on phones, tablets, TVs, and low-spec PCs for the first time. Our Xbox Game Pass subscription service now 
includes  access  to  hundreds  of  games.  And  with  our  planned  acquisition  of  Activision  Blizzard,  we  aim  to  give  players 
more choice to play great games wherever, whenever, and however they want. Choice is equally important to developers, 
who we want to support with a diversity of distribution and business models for their games. We believe the acquisition 
will unlock opportunities for innovation and enable the industry to grow.  

OUR CULTURE  

Our  culture  is  the  foundation  on  which  our  mission  and  strategy  stand,  and  cultivating  it  is  our  greatest  priority.  We’re 
always working to close the gap between our espoused culture and the lived experience of the more than  

6 

  
220,000 people who work at Microsoft. Essential to this is our commitment to continually exercise our growth mindset and 
confront  our  fixed  mindset  with  humility,  curiosity,  compassion,  and  the  recognition  that,  while  none  of  us  will  ever  be 
perfect, we can always be better than we are today.  

This growth mindset served us well through the historic changes of the past few years. It sustains our everyday practice of 
customer  obsession.  It  helps  us  care  for  our  colleagues  and  collaborate  more  effectively  across  the  company.  And  it 
deeply informs our longstanding commitment to diversity and inclusion.  

If we want to serve the world, we need to represent the world. Each year we strive to increase representation, and 2022 
was no exception. We saw  the strongest progress in years across several demographic groups,  as you can see in our 
latest Diversity & Inclusion Report. We are one of the most transparent companies of our size when it comes to the data 
we share, and we continually challenge ourselves to increase visibility into where we’re succeeding and where we need to 
address gaps. We’ve added new data, such as military status, gender representation by geography, employee exits, and 
additional pay data, to reflect our workforce more broadly. As we make meaningful progress, we continue our commitment 
to meet the increasing expectations for driving innovation, welcoming diverse perspectives, and leading global change.  

Giving is also core to our culture at Microsoft. In 2022,  our employees gave $255 million (with company match) to over 
32,000 nonprofits. And more than 29,000 employees volunteered over 720,000 hours to causes they care about.  

I’m constantly in awe of how our employees bring their passion to work each day—for each other, for our customers, and 
for their communities.  

***  

I want to close by thanking you for your continued investment in Microsoft. Our growth and impact this past year would not 
have been possible without your commitment to the company and belief in its mission.  

The  opportunity  to  apply  technology  to  make  a  real  difference  for  every  customer,  community,  and  country  has  never 
been greater. And I truly believe if we continue to live our mission, embrace our responsibility, and grasp that opportunity, 
there is no limit to what we can achieve for the world in the year ahead and beyond.

BUSINESS  

GENERAL  

Embracing Our Future  

Microsoft is a technology company whose mission is to  empower every person  and every organization on the planet to 
achieve more. We strive to create local opportunity, growth, and impact in every country around the world. Our platforms 
and  tools  help  drive  small  business  productivity,  large  business  competitiveness,  and  public-sector  efficiency.  We  are 
creating the tools and platforms that deliver better, faster, and more effective solutions to support new startups, improve 
educational and health outcomes, and empower human ingenuity.  

Microsoft is innovating and expanding our entire portfolio to help people and organizations overcome today’s challenges 
and emerge stronger. We bring technology and products together into experiences and solutions that unlock value for our 
customers.  

In a dynamic environment, digital technology is the key input that powers the world’s economic output. Our ecosystem of 
customers and partners have learned that while hybrid work is complex, embracing flexibility, different work styles, and a 
culture of trust can help navigate the challenges the world faces today. Organizations of all sizes have digitized business-
critical functions, redefining what they can expect from their business applications. Customers are looking to unlock value 
while simplifying security and management. From infrastructure and data, to business applications and collaboration, we 
provide unique, differentiated value to customers.  

We are building a distributed computing fabric  – across cloud and the edge – to help every organization build, run, and 
manage mission-critical workloads anywhere. In the next phase of innovation, artificial intelligence (“AI”) capabilities are 
rapidly advancing, fueled by data and knowledge of the world. We are enabling metaverse experiences at all layers of our 
stack,  so  customers  can  more  effectively  model,  automate,  simulate,  and  predict  changes  within  their  industrial 
environments, feel a greater sense of presence in the new world of hybrid work, and create custom immersive worlds to 
enable new opportunities for connection and experimentation.  

What We Offer  

Founded in 1975, we develop and support software, services, devices, and solutions that deliver new value for customers 
and help people and businesses realize their full potential.  

11 

We offer an array of services, including cloud-based solutions that provide customers with software, services, platforms, 
and  content,  and  we  provide  solution  support  and  consulting  services.  We  also  deliver  relevant  online  advertising  to  a 
global audience.  

Our  products  include  operating  systems,  cross-device  productivity  and  collaboration  applications,  server  applications, 
business solution applications, desktop and server management tools, software development tools, and video games. We 
also  design  and  sell  devices,  including  PCs,  tablets,  gaming  and  entertainment  consoles,  other  intelligent  devices,  and 
related accessories.  

The Ambitions That Drive Us  

To achieve our vision, our research and development efforts focus on three interconnected ambitions:  

•  Reinvent productivity and business processes.  

•  Build the intelligent cloud and intelligent edge platform.  

•  Create more personal computing.  

Reinvent Productivity and Business Processes  

At Microsoft, we provide technology and resources to help our customers create a secure hybrid work environment. Our 
family of products plays a key role in the ways the world works, learns, and connects.  

Our  growth  depends  on  securely  delivering  continuous  innovation  and  advancing  our  leading  productivity  and 
collaboration tools and services, including Office 365, Dynamics 365, and LinkedIn. Microsoft 365 brings together Office 
365,  Windows,  and  Enterprise  Mobility  +  Security  to  help  organizations  empower  their  employees  with  AI-backed  tools 
that  unlock  creativity,  increase  collaboration,  and  fuel  innovation,  all  the  while  enabling  compliance  coverage  and  data 
protection. Microsoft Teams is a comprehensive platform for work, with meetings, calls, chat, collaboration, and business 
process automation. Microsoft Viva is an employee experience platform that brings together communications, knowledge, 
learning, resources, and insights powered by Microsoft 365. Together with the Microsoft Cloud, Dynamics 365, Microsoft 
Teams,  and  Azure  Synapse  bring  a  new  era  of  collaborative  applications  that  transform  every  business  function  and 
process. Microsoft Power Platform is helping domain experts drive productivity gains with low-code/no-code tools, robotic 
process  automation,  virtual  agents,  and  business  intelligence.  In  a  dynamic  labor  market,  LinkedIn  is  helping 
professionals use the platform to connect, learn, grow, and get hired.  

Build the Intelligent Cloud and Intelligent Edge Platform  

As digital transformation accelerates, organizations in every sector across the globe can address challenges that will have 
a fundamental impact on their success. For  enterprises, digital technology empowers employees, optimizes operations, 
engages customers, and in some cases, changes the very core  of products and services. Microsoft has  a proven track 
record of delivering high value to our customers across many diverse and durable growth markets.  

We  continue  to  invest  in  high  performance  and  sustainable  computing  to  meet  the  growing  demand  for  fast  access  to 
Microsoft  services  provided  by  our  network  of  cloud  computing  infrastructure  and  datacenters.  Azure  is  a  trusted  cloud 
with comprehensive compliance coverage and AI-based security built in.  

Our  cloud  business  benefits  from  three  economies  of  scale:  datacenters  that  deploy  computational  resources  at 
significantly  lower  cost  per  unit  than  smaller  ones;  datacenters  that  coordinate  and  aggregate  diverse  customer, 
geographic, and application demand patterns, improving the utilization of computing, storage, and network resources; and 
multi-tenancy locations that lower application maintenance labor costs.  

12 

  
The Microsoft Cloud is the most comprehensive and trusted cloud, providing the best integration  across the technology 
stack while offering openness, improving time to value, reducing costs, and increasing agility. Being a global-scale cloud, 
Azure uniquely offers hybrid consistency, developer productivity, AI capabilities, and trusted security and compliance. We 
see more emerging use cases and needs for compute and security at the edge and are accelerating our innovation across 
the spectrum of intelligent edge devices, from Internet of Things (“IoT”) sensors to gateway devices and edge hardware to 
build, manage, and secure edge workloads. With Azure Stack, organizations can extend Azure into their own datacenters 
to create a consistent stack across the public cloud and the intelligent edge.  

Our hybrid infrastructure consistency spans security, compliance, identity, and management, helping to support the real-
world  needs  and  evolving  regulatory  requirements  of  commercial  customers  and  enterprises.  Our  industry  clouds  bring 
together  capabilities  across  the  entire  Microsoft  Cloud,  along  with  industry-specific  customizations,  to  improve  time  to 
value,  increase  agility,  and  lower  costs.  Azure  Arc  simplifies  governance  and  management  by  delivering  a  consistent 
multi-cloud and on-premises management platform. Security, compliance, identity, and management underlie our entire 
tech stack. We offer integrated, end-to-end capabilities to protect people and organizations.  

In  March  2022,  we  completed  our  acquisition  of  Nuance  Communications,  Inc.  (“Nuance”).  Together,  Microsoft  and 
Nuance will enable organizations across industries to accelerate their business goals with security-focused, cloud-based 
solutions infused with powerful, vertically optimized AI.  

We  are  accelerating  our  development  of  mixed  reality  solutions  with  new  Azure  services  and  devices.  Microsoft  Mesh 
enables  presence and shared  experiences from  anywhere through mixed  reality applications. The opportunity to merge 
the  physical  and  digital  worlds,  when  combined  with  the  power  of  Azure  cloud  services,  unlocks  new  workloads  and 
experiences to create common understanding and drive more informed decisions.  

The ability to convert data into AI drives our competitive advantage. Azure SQL Database makes it possible for customers 
to take SQL Server from their on-premises datacenter to a fully managed instance in the cloud to utilize built-in AI. Azure 
Synapse  brings  together  data  integration,  enterprise  data  warehousing,  and  big  data  analytics  in  a  comprehensive 
solution. We are accelerating adoption of AI innovations from research to products. Our innovation helps every developer 
be  an  AI  developer,  with  approachable  new  tools  from  Azure  Machine  Learning  Studio  for  creating  simple  machine 
learning  models,  to  the  powerful  Azure  Machine  Learning  Workbench  for  the  most  advanced  AI  modeling  and  data 
science.  From  GitHub  to  Visual  Studio,  we  provide  a  developer  tool  chain  for  everyone,  no  matter  the  technical 
experience, across all platforms, whether Azure, Windows, or any other cloud or client platform.  

Additionally, we are extending our infrastructure beyond the planet, bringing cloud computing to space. Azure Orbital is a 
fully managed ground station as a service for fast downlinking of data.  

Create More Personal Computing  

We strive to make computing more personal by putting people at the core of the experience, enabling them to interact with 
technology in more intuitive, engaging, and dynamic ways. Microsoft 365 is empowering people and organizations to be 
productive and secure as they adapt to more fluid ways of working, learning, and playing. Windows also plays a critical 
role in fueling our cloud business with Windows 365, a desktop operating system that’s also a cloud service. From another 
internet-connected device, including Android or macOS devices, you can run Windows 365, just like a virtual machine.  

With Windows 11, we have simplified the design and experience to empower productivity and inspire creativity. Windows 
11 offers innovations focused on enhancing productivity and is designed to support hybrid work. It adds new experiences 
that include powerful task switching tools like new snap layouts, snap groups, and desktops; new ways to stay connected 
through Microsoft  Teams chat; the information you want at your fingertips; and more. Windows 11 security  and  privacy 
features include operating system security, application security, and user and identity security.  

13 

  
Tools  like  search,  news,  and  maps  have  given  us  immediate  access  to  the  world’s  information.  Today,  through  our 
Search,  News,  Mapping,  and  Browse  services,  Microsoft  delivers  unique  trust,  privacy,  and  safety  features.  Microsoft 
Edge is our fast and secure browser that helps protect your data, with built-in shopping tools designed to save you time 
and money. Organizational tools such as Collections, Vertical Tabs, and Immersive Reader help make the most of your 
time while browsing, streaming, searching, and sharing.  

We are committed to designing and marketing first-party devices to help drive innovation, create new device categories, 
and stimulate demand in the Windows ecosystem. The Surface family includes Surface Laptop Studio, Surface Laptop 4, 
Surface Laptop Go 2, Surface Laptop Pro 8, Surface Pro X, Surface Go 3, Surface Studio 2, and Surface Duo 2.  

With  three  billion  people  actively  playing  games  today,  and  a  new  generation  steeped  in  interactive  entertainment, 
Microsoft  continues  to  invest  in  content,  community,  and  cloud  services.  We  have  broadened  our  approach  to  how  we 
think about gaming end-to-end, from the way games are created and distributed to how they are played, including cloud 
gaming  so  players  can  stream  across  PC,  console,  and  mobile.  We  have  a  strong  position  with  our  large  and  growing 
highly engaged community of gamers, including the acquisition of ZeniMax Media Inc., the parent company of Bethesda 
Softworks LLC. In January 2022, we announced plans to acquire Activision Blizzard, Inc., a leader in game development 
and an interactive entertainment content publisher. Xbox Game Pass is a community with access to a curated library of 
over 100 first- and third-party console and PC titles. Xbox Cloud Gaming is Microsoft’s game streaming technology that is 
complementary to our console hardware and gives fans the ultimate choice to play the games they want, with the people 
they want, on the devices they want.  

Our Future Opportunity  

The case for digital transformation has never been more urgent. Customers are looking to us to help improve productivity 
and  the  affordability  of  their  products  and  services.  We  continue  to  develop  complete,  intelligent  solutions  for  our 
customers  that  empower  people  to  stay  productive  and  collaborate,  while  safeguarding  businesses  and  simplifying  IT 
management. Our goal is to lead the industry in several distinct areas of technology over the long term, which we expect 
will translate to sustained growth. We are investing significant resources in:  

•  Transforming the workplace to deliver new modern, modular business applications, drive deeper insights, and 

improve how people communicate, collaborate, learn, work, play, and interact with one another.  

•  Building  and  running  cloud-based  services  in  ways  that  unleash  new  experiences  and  opportunities  for 

businesses and individuals.  

•  Applying AI to drive insights and act on our customer’s behalf by understanding and interpreting their needs 

using natural methods of communication.  

•  Tackling  security  from  all  angles  with  our  integrated,  end-to-end  solutions  spanning  security,  compliance, 

identity, and management, across all clouds and platforms.  

• 

Inventing  new  gaming  experiences  that  bring  people  together  around  their  shared  love  for  games  on  any 
devices and pushing the boundaries of innovation with console and PC gaming by creating the next wave of 
entertainment.  

•  Using  Windows  to  fuel  our  cloud  business,  grow  our  share  of  the  PC  market,  and  drive  increased 
engagement  with  our  services  like  Microsoft  365  Consumer,  Teams,  Edge,  Bing,  Xbox  Game  Pass,  and 
more.  

Our future  growth depends  on our ability to transcend current product category definitions,  business  models, and sales 
motions. We have  the  opportunity to redefine what customers and partners can expect  and are working to deliver new 
solutions that reflect the best of Microsoft.

Corporate Social Responsibility  

Commitment to Sustainability  

We work to ensure that technology is inclusive, trusted, and increases sustainability. We are accelerating progress toward 
a  more  sustainable  future  by  reducing  our  environmental  footprint,  advancing  research,  helping  our  customers  build 
sustainable  solutions,  and  advocating  for  policies  that  benefit  the  environment.  In  January  2020,  we  announced  a  bold 
commitment and detailed plan to be carbon negative by 2030, and to remove from the environment by 2050 all the carbon 
we  have  emitted  since  our  founding  in  1975.  This  included  a  commitment  to  invest  $1 billion  over  four  years  in  new 
technologies  and  innovative  climate  solutions.  We  built  on  this  pledge  by  adding  commitments  to  be  water  positive  by 
2030, zero waste by 2030, and to protect ecosystems by developing a Planetary Computer. We also help our suppliers 
and customers around the world use Microsoft technology to reduce their own carbon footprint.  

Fiscal year 2021 was a year of both successes and challenges. While we continued to make progress on several of our 
goals, with an overall reduction in our combined Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, our Scope 3 emissions increased, due 
in  substantial  part  to  significant  global  datacenter  expansions  and  growth  in  Xbox  sales  and  usage  as  a  result  of  the 
COVID-19  pandemic.  Despite  these  Scope  3  increases,  we  will  continue  to  build  the  foundations  and  do  the  work  to 
deliver on our commitments, and help our customers and partners achieve theirs. We have learned the impact of our work 
will not all be felt immediately, and our experience highlights how progress won’t always be linear.  

While fiscal year 2021 presented us with some new learnings, we also made some great progress. A few examples that 
illuminate the diversity of our work include:  

•  We purchased the removal of 1.4 million metrics tons of carbon.  

•  Four of our datacenters received new or renewed Zero Waste certifications.  

•  We granted $100 million to Breakthrough Energy Catalyst to accelerate the development of climate solutions 
the  world  needs  to  reach  net-zero  across  four  key  areas:  direct  air  capture,  green  hydrogen,  long  duration 
energy storage, and sustainable aviation fuel.  

•  We  joined  the  First  Movers  Coalition  as  an  early  leader  and  expert  partner  in  the  carbon  dioxide  removal 

sector, with a commitment of $200 million toward carbon removal by 2030.  

Sustainability is an existential priority for our society and businesses today. This led us to create our Microsoft Cloud for 
Sustainability, an entirely new business process category to help organizations monitor their carbon footprint across their 
operations. We also joined with leading organizations to launch the Carbon Call – an initiative to mobilize collective action 
to solve carbon emissions and removal accounting challenges for a net zero future.  

The investments we make in sustainability carry through to our products, services, and devices. We design our devices, 
from  Surface  to  Xbox,  to  minimize  their  impact  on  the  environment.  Our  cloud  and  AI  services  and  datacenters  help 
businesses cut energy consumption, reduce physical footprints, and design sustainable products.  

Addressing Racial Injustice and Inequity  

We  are  committed  to  addressing  racial  injustice  and  inequity  in  the  United  States  for  Black  and  African  American 
communities  and  helping  improve  lived  experiences  at  Microsoft,  in  employees’  communities,  and  beyond.  Our  Racial 
Equity Initiative focuses on three multi-year pillars, each containing actions and progress we expect to make or exceed by 
2025.  

•  Strengthening our communities: using data, technology, and partnerships to help improve the lives of Black 

and African American people in the United States, including our employees and their communities.  

•  Evolving  our  ecosystem:  using  our  balance  sheet  and  relationships  with  suppliers  and  partners  to  foster 

societal change and create new opportunities.  

15 

  
• 

Increasing  representation  and  strengthening  inclusion:  build  on  our  momentum,  adding  a  $150 million 
investment to strengthen inclusion and double the number of Black, African American, Hispanic, and Latinx 
leaders in the United States by 2025.  

Over the last year, we collaborated with partners and worked within neighborhoods and communities to launch and scale 
a number of projects and programs, including: working with 70 organizations in 145 communities on the Justice Reform 
Initiative, expanding access to affordable broadband  and devices for Black and African American communities  and key 
institutions  that  support  them  in  major  urban  centers,  expanding  access  to  skills  and  education  to  support  Black  and 
African American students and adults to succeed in the digital economy, and increasing technology support for nonprofits 
that provide critical services to Black and African American communities.  

We have  made meaningful  progress  on representation  and inclusion at  Microsoft. We  are  90 percent of the way to our 
2025 commitment to double the number of Black and African American people managers, senior individual contributors, 
and  senior  leaders  in  the  U.S.,  and  50 percent  of  the  way  for  Hispanic  and  Latinx  people  managers,  senior  individual 
contributors, and senior leaders in the U.S.  

We  exceeded  our  goal  on  increasing  the  percentage  of  transaction  volumes  with  Black-  and  African  American-owned 
financial institutions and increased our deposits with Black- and African American-owned minority depository institutions, 
enabling  increased  funds  into  local  communities.  Additionally,  we  enriched  our  supplier  pipeline,  reaching  more  than 
90 percent of our goal to spend $500 million with double the number of Black and African American-owned suppliers. We 
also increased the number of identified partners in the Black Partner Growth Initiative and continue to invest in the partner 
community through the Black Channel Partner Alliance  by supporting events focused on business growth, accelerators, 
and mentorship.  

Progress does not undo the egregious injustices of the past or diminish those who continue to live with inequity. We are 
committed  to  leveraging  our  resources  to  help  accelerate  diversity  and  inclusion  across  our  ecosystem  and  to  hold 
ourselves accountable to accelerate change – for Microsoft, and beyond.  

Investing in Digital Skills  

The  COVID-19  pandemic  led  to  record  unemployment,  disrupting  livelihoods  of  people  around  the  world.  After  helping 
over  30 million  people  in  249  countries  and  territories  with  our  global  skills  initiative,  we  introduced  a  new  initiative  to 
support a more skills-based labor market, with greater flexibility and accessible learning paths to develop the right skills 
needed for the most in-demand jobs. Our skills initiative brings together learning resources, certification opportunities, and 
job-seeker tools from LinkedIn, GitHub, and Microsoft Learn, and is built on data insights drawn from LinkedIn’s Economic 
Graph. We previously invested $20 million in key non-profit partnerships through Microsoft Philanthropies to help people 
from underserved communities that are often excluded by the digital economy.  

We  also  launched  a  national  campaign  with  U.S.  community  colleges  to  help  skill  and  recruit  into  the  cybersecurity 
workforce  250,000  people  by  2025,  representing  half  of  the  country’s  workforce  shortage.  To  that  end,  we  are  making 
curriculum available free of charge to all of the nation’s public community colleges, providing training for new and existing 
faculty at 150 community colleges, and providing scholarships and supplemental resources to 25,000 students.  

Overview  

HUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES  

Microsoft  aims to  recruit, develop, and retain world-changing talent from a diversity of  backgrounds. To  foster their and 
our success, we seek to create an environment where people can thrive, where they can do their best work, where they 
can proudly be their authentic selves, guided by our values, and where they know their needs can be met. We strive to 
maximize  the  potential  of  our  human  capital  resources  by  creating  a  respectful,  rewarding,  and  inclusive  work 
environment that enables our global employees to create products and services that further our mission to empower every 
person and every organization on the planet to achieve more.

As of June 30, 2022, we employed approximately 221,000 people on a full-time basis, 122,000 in  the U.S. and  99,000 
internationally.  Of  the  total  employed  people,  85,000  were  in  operations,  including  manufacturing,  distribution,  product 
support, and consulting services; 73,000 were in product research and development; 47,000 were in sales and marketing; 
and 16,000 were in general and administration. Certain employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements.  

Our Culture  

Microsoft’s culture is grounded in the growth mindset. This means everyone is on a continuous journey to learn and grow. 
We believe potential can be nurtured and is not pre-determined, and we should always be learning and curious  – trying 
new things without fear of failure. We identified four attributes that allow growth mindset to flourish:  

•  Obsessing over what matters to our customers.  

•  Becoming more diverse and inclusive in everything we do.  

•  Operating as one company, One Microsoft, instead of multiple siloed businesses.  

•  Making a difference in the lives of each other, our customers, and the world around us.  

Our  employee  listening  systems  enable  us  to  gather  feedback  directly  from  our  workforce  to  inform  our  programs  and 
employee needs globally. Seventy  percent of employees globally participated in  our fiscal year 2022 Employee Signals 
survey,  which  covers  a  variety  of  topics  such  as  thriving,  inclusion,  team  culture,  wellbeing,  and  learning  and 
development.  Throughout  the fiscal year, we collect  over 75,000 Daily Pulse employee survey responses. During fiscal 
year  2022,  our  Daily  Pulse  surveys  gave  us  invaluable  insights  into  ways  we  could  support  employees  through  the 
COVID-19 pandemic, addressing racial injustice, the war in Ukraine, and their general wellbeing. In addition to Employee 
Signals  and  Daily  Pulse  surveys,  we  gain  insights  through  onboarding,  internal  mobility,  leadership,  performance  and 
development, exit surveys, internal Yammer channels, employee Q&A sessions, and AskHR Service support.  

Diversity and Inclusion  

At Microsoft we have an inherently inclusive mission: to empower every person and every organization on the planet to 
achieve  more.  We  think  of  diversity  and  inclusion  as  core  to  our  business  model,  informing  our  actions  to  impact 
economies and people around the world. There are billions of people who want to achieve more, but have a different set 
of  circumstances,  abilities,  and  backgrounds  that  often  limit  access  to  opportunity  and  achievement.  The  better  we 
represent that diversity inside Microsoft, the more effectively we can innovate for those we seek to empower.  

We strive to include others by holding ourselves accountable for diversity, driving global systemic change in our workplace 
and workforce, and creating an inclusive work environment. Through this commitment we can allow everyone the chance 
to  be  their  authentic  selves  and  do  their  best  work  every  day.  We  support  multiple  highly  active  Employee  Resource 
Groups for women, families, racial and ethnic minorities, military, people with disabilities, and employees who identify as 
LGBTQIA+, where employees can go for support, networking, and community-building. As described in our 2021 Proxy 
Statement, annual performance and compensation  reviews of our senior leadership team include an evaluation  of their 
contributions to employee culture and diversity. To ensure accountability over time, we publicly disclose our progress on a 
multitude of workforce metrics including:  

•  Detailed  breakdowns  of  gender,  racial,  and  ethnic  minority  representation  in  our  employee  population,  with 

data by job types, levels, and segments of our business.  

•  Our EEO-1 report (equal employment opportunity).  

•  Disability representation.  

•  Pay equity (see details below).

Total Rewards  

We develop dynamic, sustainable, market-driven, and strategic programs with the goal of providing a highly differentiated 
portfolio to attract, reward, and retain top talent and enable our employees to thrive. These programs reinforce our culture 
and  values  such  as  collaboration  and  growth  mindset.  Managers  evaluate  and  recommend  rewards  based  on,  for 
example, how well we leverage the work of others and contribute to the success of our colleagues. We monitor pay equity 
and career progress across multiple dimensions.  

As part of our effort to promote a One Microsoft and inclusive culture, in fiscal year 2021 we expanded stock eligibility to 
all Microsoft employees as part of our annual rewards process. This includes all non-exempt and exempt employees and 
equivalents across the globe including business support professionals and datacenter and retail employees. In response 
to the Great Reshuffle, in fiscal year 2022 we announced a sizable investment in annual merit and annual stock award 
opportunity  for  all  employees  below  senior  executive  levels.  We  also  invested  in  base  salary  adjustments  for  our 
datacenter  and  retail  hourly  employees  and  hourly  equivalents  outside  the  U.S.  These  investments  have  supported 
retention and help to ensure that Microsoft remains an employer of choice.  

Pay Equity  

In our 2021 Diversity and Inclusion Report, we reported that all racial and ethnic minority employees in the U.S. combined 
earn  $1.006 for every $1.000 earned  by their white counterparts, that women in the U.S. earn $1.002 for every $1.000 
earned  by  their  counterparts  in  the  U.S.  who  are  men,  and  women  in  the  U.S.  plus  our  twelve  other  largest  employee 
geographies  representing  86.6%  of  our  global  population  (Australia,  Canada,  China,  France,  Germany,  India,  Ireland, 
Israel,  Japan,  Romania,  Singapore,  and  the  United  Kingdom)  combined  earn  $1.001  for  every  $1.000  by  men  in  these 
countries. Our intended result is a global performance and development approach that fosters our culture, and competitive 
compensation that ensures equitable pay by role while supporting pay for performance.  

Wellness and Safety  

Microsoft is committed to supporting  our employees’ well-being  and safety while they are at work and in their personal 
lives.  

We  took  a  wide  variety  of  measures  to  protect  the  health  and  well-being  of  our  employees,  suppliers,  and  customers 
during  the  COVID-19  pandemic  and  are  now  supporting  employees  in  shifting  to  return  to  office  and/or  hybrid 
arrangements.  We  developed  hybrid  guidelines  for  managers  and  employees  to  support  the  transition  and  continue  to 
identify ways we can support hybrid work scenarios through our employee listening systems.  

We  have  invested  significantly  in  holistic  wellbeing,  and  offer  a  differentiated  benefits  package  which  includes  many 
physical,  emotional,  and  financial  wellness  programs  including  counseling  through  the  Microsoft  CARES  Employee 
Assistance  Program,  mental  wellbeing  support,  flexible  fitness  benefits,  savings  and  investment  tools,  adoption 
assistance, and back-up care for children and elders. Finally, our Occupational Health and Safety program helps ensure 
employees can stay safe while they are working.  

We continue to strive to support our Ukrainian employees and their dependents during the Ukraine crisis with emergency 
relocation assistance, emergency leave, and other benefits.  

Learning and Development  

Our  growth  mindset  culture  begins  with  valuing  learning  over  knowing  –  seeking  out  new  ideas,  driving  innovation, 
embracing challenges, learning from  failure, and improving over time.  To support this culture, we offer a wide range  of 
learning  and  development  opportunities.  We  believe  learning  can  be  more  than  formal  instruction,  and  our  learning 
philosophy focuses on providing the right learning, at the right time, in the right way. Opportunities include:  

•  Personalized, integrated, and relevant views of all learning opportunities on both our internal learning portal 
Learning (Viva Learning + LinkedIn Learning) and our external learning portal MS Learn are available to all 
employees worldwide.  

18 

  
• 

In-the-classroom  learning,  learning  cohorts,  our  early-in-career  Aspire  program,  and  manager  excellence 
communities.  

•  Required  learning  for  all  employees  and  managers  on  topics  such  as  compliance,  regulation,  company 
culture, leadership, and management. This includes the annual Standards of Business Conduct training.  

•  On-the-job “stretch” and advancement opportunities.  

•  Managers  holding  conversations  about  employees’  career  and  development  plans,  coaching  on  career 

opportunities, and programs like mentoring and sponsorship.  

•  Customized  manager  learning  to  build  people  manager  capabilities  and  similar  learning  solutions  to  build 

leadership skills for all employees including differentiated leadership development programs.  

•  New  employee  orientation  covering  a  range  of  topics  including  company  values,  and  culture,  as  well  as 

ongoing onboarding programs.  

•  New tools to assist managers and employees in learning how to operate, be productive, and connect in the 
new  flexible  hybrid  world  of  work.  These  include  quick  guides  for  teams  to  use,  such  as  Creating  Team 
Agreements, Reconnecting as a Team, and Running Effective Hybrid Meetings.  

Our employees embrace the growth mindset and take advantage of the formal learning opportunities as well as thousands 
of  informal  and  on-the-job  learning  opportunities.  In  terms  of  formal  on-line  learning  solutions,  in  fiscal  year  2022  our 
employees completed over 4.7 million courses, averaging over 14 hours per employee. Given our focus on understanding 
core  company  beliefs  and  compliance  topics,  all  employees  complete  required  learning  programs  like  Standards  of 
Business  Conduct,  Privacy,  Unconscious  Bias,  and  preventing  harassment  courses.  Our  corporate  learning  portal  has 
over 100,000 average monthly active users. We have over 27,000 people managers, all of whom must complete between 
20-33 hours of required manager capability and excellence training and are assigned ongoing required training each year. 
In addition, all employees complete skills training based on the profession they are in each year.  

New Ways of Working  

The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated our capabilities and culture with  respect to flexible work. We introduced  a Hybrid 
Workplace Flexibility Guide to better support managers and employees as they adapt to new ways of working that shift 
paradigms, embrace flexibility, promote inclusion, and drive innovation. Our ongoing survey data shows employees value 
the flexibility  related to work location, work site, and work hours, and while many have begun returning to worksites as 
conditions have permitted, they also continue to adjust hours and/or spend some of workweeks working at home, another 
site, or remotely. We are focused on building capabilities to support a variety of workstyles where individuals, teams, and 
our business can deliver success.  

OPERATING SEGMENTS  

We  operate  our  business  and  report  our  financial  performance  using  three  segments:  Productivity  and  Business 
Processes, Intelligent Cloud, and More Personal Computing. Our segments provide management with a comprehensive 
financial  view  of  our  key  businesses.  The  segments  enable  the  alignment  of  strategies  and  objectives  across  the 
development,  sales,  marketing,  and  services  organizations,  and  they  provide  a  framework  for  timely  and  rational 
allocation of resources within businesses.  

Additional  information  on  our  operating  segments  and  geographic  and  product  information  is  contained  in  Note  19  – 
Segment Information and Geographic Data of the Notes to Financial Statements in our fiscal year 2022 Form 10-K.  

Our reportable segments are described below.  

19 

  
Productivity and Business Processes  

Our  Productivity  and  Business  Processes  segment  consists  of  products  and  services  in  our  portfolio  of  productivity, 
communication, and information services, spanning a variety of devices and platforms. This segment primarily comprises:  

•  Office  Commercial  (Office  365  subscriptions,  the  Office  365  portion  of  Microsoft  365  Commercial 
subscriptions, and Office licensed on-premises), comprising Office, Exchange, SharePoint, Microsoft Teams, 
Office 365 Security and Compliance, and Microsoft Viva.

and CRM applications.  

Office Commercial  

Office  Commercial  is  designed  to  increase  personal,  team,  and  organizational  productivity  through  a  range  of  products 
and  services.  Growth  depends  on  our  ability  to  reach  new  users  in  new  markets  such  as  frontline  workers,  small  and 
medium  businesses,  and  growth  markets,  as  well  as  add  value  to  our  core  product  and  service  offerings  to  span 
productivity  categories  such  as  communication,  collaboration,  analytics,  security,  and  compliance.  Office  Commercial 
revenue is mainly affected by a combination of continued installed base growth and average revenue per user expansion, 
as well as the continued shift from Office licensed on-premises to Office 365.  

Office Consumer  

Office Consumer is designed to increase personal productivity through a range of products and services. Growth depends 
on  our  ability  to  reach  new  users,  add  value  to  our  core  product  set,  and  continue  to  expand  our  product  and  service 
offerings into new markets. Office Consumer revenue is mainly affected by the percentage of customers that buy Office 
with their new devices and the continued shift from Office licensed on-premises to Microsoft 365 Consumer subscriptions. 
Office  Consumer  Services  revenue  is  mainly  affected  by  the  demand  for  communication  and  storage  through  Skype, 
Outlook.com, and OneDrive, which is largely driven by subscriptions, advertising, and the sale of minutes.  

LinkedIn  

LinkedIn  connects  the  world’s  professionals  to  make  them  more  productive  and  successful  and  transforms  the  way 
companies  hire,  market,  sell,  and  learn.  Our  vision  is  to  create  economic  opportunity  for  every  member  of  the  global 
workforce  through  the  ongoing  development  of  the  world’s  first  Economic  Graph,  a  digital  representation  of  the  global 
economy.  In  addition  to  LinkedIn’s  free  services,  LinkedIn  offers  monetized  solutions:  Talent  Solutions,  Marketing 
Solutions, Premium Subscriptions, and Sales Solutions. Talent Solutions provide insights for workforce planning and tools 
to hire, nurture, and develop talent. Talent Solutions also includes Learning Solutions, which help businesses close critical 
skills  gaps  in  times  where  companies  are  having  to  do  more  with  existing  talent.  Marketing  Solutions  help  companies 
reach,  engage,  and  convert  their  audiences  at  scale.  Premium  Subscriptions  enables  professionals  to  manage  their 
professional identity, grow their network, and connect with talent through additional services like premium search. Sales 
Solutions help companies strengthen customer relationships, empower teams with digital selling tools, and acquire new 
opportunities. LinkedIn has over 850 million members and has offices around the globe. Growth will depend on our ability 
to  increase  the  number  of  LinkedIn  members  and  our  ability  to  continue  offering  services  that  provide  value  for  our 
members  and  increase  their  engagement.  LinkedIn  revenue  is  mainly  affected  by  demand  from  enterprises  and 
professional organizations for subscriptions to Talent Solutions, Sales Solutions, and Premium Subscriptions offerings, as 
well  as  member  engagement  and  the  quality  of  the  sponsored  content  delivered  to  those  members  to  drive  Marketing 
Solutions.  

20 

  
Dynamics  

Dynamics  provides  cloud-based  and  on-premises  business  solutions  for  financial  management,  enterprise  resource 
planning  (“ERP”),  customer  relationship  management  (“CRM”),  supply  chain  management,  and  other  application 
development  platforms  for  small  and  medium  businesses,  large  organizations,  and  divisions  of  global  enterprises. 
Dynamics revenue is driven by the number of users licensed and applications consumed, expansion of average revenue 
per user, and the continued shift to Dynamics 365, a unified set of cloud-based intelligent business applications, including 
Power Apps and Power Automate.  

Competition  

Competitors to Office include software and global application vendors, such as Apple, Cisco Systems, Meta, Google, IBM, 
Okta, Proofpoint, Slack, Symantec, Zoom, and numerous web-based and mobile application competitors as well as local 
application  developers.  Apple  distributes  versions  of  its  pre-installed  application  software,  such  as  email  and  calendar 
products,  through  its  PCs,  tablets,  and  phones.  Cisco  Systems  is  using  its  position  in  enterprise  communications 
equipment  to  grow  its  unified  communications  business.  Google  provides  a  hosted  messaging  and  productivity  suite.

Proofpoint,  and  Symantec  provide  security  solutions  across  email  security,  information  protection,  identity,  and 
governance. Web-based offerings competing with individual applications have also positioned themselves as alternatives 
to our products and services. We compete by providing powerful, flexible, secure, integrated industry-specific, and easy-
to-use  productivity  and  collaboration  tools  and  services  that  create  comprehensive  solutions  and  work  well  with 
technologies our customers already have both on-premises or in the cloud.  

LinkedIn faces competition from online professional networks, recruiting companies, talent management companies, and 
larger companies that are focusing on talent management and human resource services; job boards; traditional recruiting 
firms; and companies that provide learning and development products and services. Marketing Solutions competes with 
online and offline outlets that generate revenue from advertisers and marketers, and Sales Solutions competes with online 
and offline outlets for companies with lead generation and customer intelligence and insights.  

Dynamics competes with cloud-based and on-premises business solution providers such as Oracle, Salesforce, and SAP.  

Intelligent Cloud  

Our  Intelligent  Cloud  segment  consists  of  our  public,  private,  and  hybrid  server  products  and  cloud  services  that  can 
power modern business and developers. This segment primarily comprises:  

•  Server products and cloud services, including Azure and other cloud services; SQL Server, Windows Server, 

Visual Studio, System Center, and related Client Access Licenses (“CALs”); and Nuance and GitHub.  

•  Enterprise  Services,  including  Enterprise  Support  Services,  Microsoft  Consulting  Services,  and  Nuance 

professional services.  

Server Products and Cloud Services  

Azure is a comprehensive set of cloud services that offer developers, IT professionals, and enterprises freedom to build, 
deploy,  and  manage  applications  on  any  platform  or  device.  Customers  can  use  Azure  through  our  global  network  of 
datacenters  for  computing,  networking,  storage,  mobile  and  web  application  services,  AI,  IoT,  cognitive  services,  and 
machine learning. Azure enables customers to devote more resources to development and use of applications that benefit 
their  organizations,  rather  than  managing  on-premises  hardware  and  software.  Azure  revenue  is  mainly  affected  by 
infrastructure-as-a-service and platform-as-a-service consumption-based services, and per user-based services such as 
Enterprise Mobility + Security.  

21 

  
Our server products are designed to make IT professionals, developers, and their systems more productive and efficient. 
Server software is integrated server infrastructure and middleware designed to support software applications built on the 
Windows  Server  operating  system.  This  includes  the  server  platform,  database,  business  intelligence,  storage, 
management and operations, virtualization, service-oriented architecture platform, security, and identity software. We also 
license  standalone  and  software  development  lifecycle  tools  for  software  architects,  developers,  testers,  and  project 
managers. GitHub provides a collaboration platform and code hosting service for developers. Server products revenue is 
mainly  affected  by  purchases  through  volume  licensing  programs,  licenses  sold  to  original  equipment  manufacturers 
(“OEM”), and retail packaged products. CALs provide access rights to certain server products, including SQL Server and 
Windows Server, and revenue is reported along with the associated server product.  

Nuance  and  GitHub  include  both  cloud  and  on-premises  offerings.  Nuance  provides  healthcare  and  enterprise  AI 
solutions. GitHub provides a collaboration platform and code hosting service for developers.

Services,  assist  customers  in  developing,  deploying,  and  managing  Microsoft  server  solutions,  Microsoft  desktop 
solutions, and Nuance conversational AI and ambient intelligent solutions, along with providing training and certification to 
developers and IT professionals on various Microsoft products.  

Competition  

Azure  faces  diverse  competition  from  companies  such  as  Amazon,  Google,  IBM,  Oracle,  VMware,  and  open  source 
offerings. Our Enterprise Mobility + Security offerings also compete with products from a range of competitors including 
identity  vendors,  security  solution  vendors,  and  numerous  other  security  point  solution  vendors.  Azure’s  competitive 
advantage  includes  enabling  a  hybrid  cloud,  allowing  deployment  of  existing  datacenters  with  our  public  cloud  into  a 
single,  cohesive  infrastructure,  and  the  ability  to  run  at  a  scale  that  meets  the  needs  of  businesses  of  all  sizes  and 
complexities. We believe our cloud’s global scale, coupled with our broad portfolio of identity and security solutions, allows 
us to effectively solve complex cybersecurity challenges for our customers and differentiates us from the competition.  

Our  server  products  face  competition  from  a  wide  variety  of  server  operating  systems  and  applications  offered  by 
companies with a  range of market approaches. Vertically integrated computer manufacturers such as Hewlett-Packard, 
IBM,  and  Oracle  offer  their  own  versions  of  the  Unix  operating  system  preinstalled  on  server  hardware.  Nearly  all 
computer  manufacturers  offer  server  hardware  for  the  Linux  operating  system  and  many  contribute  to  Linux  operating 
system  development.  The  competitive  position  of  Linux  has  also  benefited  from  the  large  number  of  compatible 
applications now produced by many commercial and non-commercial software developers. A number of companies, such 
as Red Hat, supply versions of Linux.  

We  compete  to  provide  enterprise-wide  computing  solutions  and  point  solutions  with  numerous  commercial  software 
vendors that offer solutions and middleware technology platforms, software applications for connectivity (both Internet and 
intranet), security, hosting, database, and e-business servers. IBM and Oracle lead a group of companies focused on the 
Java Platform Enterprise Edition that competes with our enterprise-wide computing solutions. Commercial competitors for 
our  server  applications  for  PC-based  distributed  client-server  environments  include  CA  Technologies,  IBM,  and  Oracle. 
Our web application platform software competes with open source software such as Apache, Linux, MySQL, and PHP. In 
middleware, we compete against Java vendors.  

Our database, business intelligence, and data warehousing solutions offerings compete with products from IBM, Oracle, 
SAP, Snowflake, and other companies. Our system management solutions compete with server management and server 
virtualization platform providers, such as BMC, CA Technologies, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, and VMware. Our  products for 
software developers compete  against  offerings from Adobe, IBM, Oracle, and other companies, and  also against open-
source projects, including Eclipse (sponsored by CA Technologies, IBM, Oracle, and SAP), PHP, and Ruby on Rails.  

22 

  
We  believe  our  server  products  provide  customers  with  advantages  in  performance,  total  costs  of  ownership,  and 
productivity  by  delivering  superior  applications,  development  tools,  compatibility  with  a  broad  base  of  hardware  and 
software applications, security, and manageability.  

Our Enterprise Services business competes with a wide range of companies that provide strategy and business planning, 
application development, and infrastructure services, including multinational consulting firms and small niche businesses 
focused on specific technologies.  

More Personal Computing  

Our  More  Personal  Computing  segment  consists  of  products  and  services  that  put  customers  at  the  center  of  the 
experience with our technology. This segment primarily comprises:  

•  Windows,  including  Windows  OEM  licensing  (“Windows  OEM”)  and  other  non-volume  licensing  of  the 
Windows  operating  system;  Windows  Commercial,  comprising  volume  licensing  of  the  Windows  operating 
system,  Windows  cloud  services,  and  other  Windows  commercial  offerings;  patent  licensing;  and  Windows 
Internet of Things.  

•  Devices, including Surface and PC accessories.  

•  Gaming,  including  Xbox  hardware  and  Xbox  content  and  services,  comprising  first-  and  third-party  content 
(including  games  and  in-game  content),  Xbox  Game  Pass  and  other  subscriptions,  Xbox  Cloud  Gaming, 
third-party disc royalties, advertising, and other cloud services.  

•  Search and news advertising.  

Windows  

The  Windows  operating  system  is  designed  to  deliver  a  more  personal  computing  experience  for  users  by  enabling 
consistency  of  experience,  applications,  and  information  across  their  devices.  Windows  OEM  revenue  is  impacted 
significantly  by  the  number  of  Windows  operating  system  licenses  purchased  by  OEMs,  which  they  pre-install  on  the 
devices they sell. In addition to computing device market volume, Windows OEM revenue is impacted by:  

•  The mix of computing devices based on form factor and screen size.  

•  Differences in device market demand between developed markets and growth markets.  

•  Attachment of Windows to devices shipped.  

•  Customer mix between consumer, small and medium businesses, and large enterprises.  

•  Changes in inventory levels in the OEM channel.  

•  Pricing changes  and promotions, pricing variation that  occurs when the  mix of devices manufactured shifts 
from  local  and  regional  system  builders  to  large  multinational  OEMs,  and  different  pricing  of  Windows 
versions licensed.  

•  Constraints in the supply chain of device components.  

•  Piracy.  

Windows  Commercial  revenue,  which  includes  volume  licensing  of  the  Windows  operating  system  and  Windows  cloud 
services  such  as  Microsoft  Defender  for  Endpoint,  is  affected  mainly  by  the  demand  from  commercial  customers  for 
volume licensing and Software Assurance (“SA”), as well as advanced security offerings. Windows Commercial revenue 
often reflects the  number of information workers in a licensed enterprise and is relatively independent of the  number of 
PCs sold in a given year.  

Patent  licensing  includes  our  programs  to  license  patents  we  own  for  use  across  a  broad  array  of  technology  areas, 
including mobile devices and cloud offerings.  

Windows  IoT  extends  the  power  of  Windows  and  the  cloud  to  intelligent  systems  by  delivering  specialized  operating 
systems, tools, and services for use in embedded devices.  

23 

  
Devices  

We  design  and  sell  devices,  including  Surface  and  PC  accessories.  Our  devices  are  designed  to  enable  people  and 
organizations to connect to the people and content that matter most using Windows and integrated Microsoft products and 
services. Surface is designed to help organizations, students, and consumers be more productive. Growth in Devices is 
dependent  on  total  PC  shipments,  the  ability  to  attract  new  customers,  our  product  roadmap,  and  expanding  into  new 
categories.  

Gaming  

Our  gaming  platform  is  designed  to  provide  a  variety  of  entertainment  through  a  unique  combination  of  content, 
community,  and  cloud.  Our  exclusive  game  content  is  created  through  Xbox  Game  Studios,  a  collection  of  first-party 
studios creating iconic and differentiated gaming experiences. We continue to invest in new gaming studios and content to 
expand  our  IP  roadmap  and  leverage  new  content  creators.  These  unique  gaming  experiences  are  the  cornerstone  of 
Xbox  Game Pass, a subscription service and gaming community with access to  a curated library of  over 100 first- and 
third-party console and PC titles.  

The gamer remains  at the heart  of the Xbox ecosystem. We continue to open new opportunities for gamers to  engage 
both  on-  and  off-console  with  both  the  launch  of  Xbox  Cloud  Gaming,  our  game  streaming  service,  and  continued 
investment in gaming hardware. Xbox Cloud Gaming utilizes Microsoft’s Azure cloud technology to allow direct and on-
demand  streaming  of  games  to  PCs,  consoles,  and  mobile  devices,  enabling  gamers  to  take  their  favorite  games  with 
them and play on the device most convenient to them.  

Xbox enables people to connect and share online gaming experiences that are accessible on Xbox consoles, Windows-
enabled  devices,  and  other  devices. Xbox  is  designed  to  benefit  users  by  providing  access  to  a  network  of  certified 
applications and services and to benefit our developer and partner ecosystems by providing access to a large customer 
base. Xbox revenue is mainly affected by subscriptions and sales of first- and third-party content, as well as advertising. 
Growth of our Gaming business is determined by the overall active user base through Xbox enabled content, availability 
of games, providing exclusive game content that gamers seek, the computational power and reliability of the devices used 
to access our content and services, and the ability to create new experiences through first-party content creators.  

Search and News Advertising  

Our  Search  and  news  advertising  business  is  designed  to  deliver  relevant  search,  native,  and  display  advertising  to  a 
global  audience.  We  have  several  partnerships  with  other  companies,  including  Yahoo,  through  which  we  provide  and 
monetize  search  queries.  Growth  depends  on  our  ability  to  attract  new  users,  understand  intent,  and  match  intent  with 
relevant content and advertiser offerings.  

On  June 6,  2022,  we  acquired  Xandr,  Inc.,  a  technology  platform  with  tools  to  accelerate  the  delivery  of  our  digital 
advertising solutions.  

Competition  

Windows faces competition from various software products and from alternative platforms and devices, mainly from Apple 
and Google. We believe Windows competes effectively by giving customers choice, value, flexibility, security, an easy-to-
use  interface,  and  compatibility  with  a  broad  range  of  hardware  and  software  applications,  including  those  that  enable 
productivity.  

Devices face competition from various computer, tablet, and hardware manufacturers who offer a unique combination of 
high-quality  industrial  design  and  innovative  technologies  across  various  price  points.  These  manufacturers,  many  of 
which are also current or potential partners and customers, include Apple and our Windows OEMs.  

24 

  
Xbox  and  our  cloud  gaming  services  face  competition  from  various  online  gaming  ecosystems  and  game  streaming 
services, including those operated by Amazon, Apple, Meta, Google, and Tencent. We also compete with other providers 
of entertainment services such as video streaming platforms. Our gaming platform competes with console platforms from 
Nintendo  and  Sony,  both  of  which  have  a  large,  established  base  of  customers. We  believe  our  gaming  platform  is 
effectively  positioned  against,  and  uniquely  differentiated  from,  competitive  products  and  services  based  on  significant 
innovation  in  hardware  architecture,  user  interface,  developer  tools,  online  gaming  and  entertainment  services,  and 
continued strong exclusive content from our own first-party game franchises as well as other digital content offerings.  

Our  Search  and  news  advertising  business  competes  with  Google  and  a  wide  array  of  websites,  social  platforms  like 
Meta, and portals that provide content and online offerings to end users.  

OPERATIONS  

We have operations centers  that support operations in their regions, including customer contract and order processing, 
credit  and  collections,  information  processing,  and  vendor  management  and  logistics.  The  regional  center  in  Ireland 
supports the European,  Middle Eastern,  and African region; the center in Singapore supports the Japan,  India,  Greater 
China, and Asia-Pacific region; and the centers in Fargo, North Dakota, Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Puerto Rico, Redmond, 
Washington, and Reno, Nevada support Latin America and North America. In addition to the operations centers, we also 
operate datacenters throughout the Americas, Europe, Australia, and Asia, as well as in the Middle East and Africa.  

To  serve  the  needs  of  customers  around  the world and to improve  the quality and  usability  of  products in international 
markets, we localize many of our products to reflect local languages and conventions. Localizing a product may require 
modifying the user interface, altering dialog boxes, and translating text.  

Our devices are primarily manufactured by third-party contract manufacturers. For the majority of our products, we have 
the  ability  to  use  other  manufacturers  if  a  current  vendor  becomes  unavailable  or  unable  to  meet  our  requirements. 
However,  some  of  our  products  contain  certain  components  for  which  there  are  very  few  qualified  suppliers.  For  these 
components, we have limited near-term flexibility to use other manufacturers if a current vendor becomes unavailable or is 
unable  to  meet  our  requirements.  Extended  disruptions  at  these  suppliers  and/or  manufacturers  could  lead  to  a  similar 
disruption in our ability to manufacture devices on time to meet consumer demand.  

Product and Service Development, and Intellectual Property  

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT  

We develop most of our products and services internally through the following engineering groups.  

•  Cloud  and  AI,  focuses  on  making  IT  professionals,  developers,  and  their  systems  more  productive  and 
efficient  through  development  of  cloud  infrastructure,  server,  database,  CRM,  ERP,  software  development 
tools  and  services  (including  GitHub),  AI  cognitive  services,  and  other  business  process  applications  and 
services for enterprises.  

•  Experiences and Devices, focuses on instilling a unifying product ethos across our end-user experiences and 
devices,  including  Office,  Windows,  Teams,  consumer  web  experiences  (including  search  and  news 
advertising), and the Surface line of devices.  

•  Security, Compliance, Identity, and Management, focuses on cloud platform and application security, identity 

and network access, enterprise mobility, information protection, and managed services.   

•  Technology  and  Research,  focuses  on  our  AI  innovations  and  other  forward-looking  research  and 

development efforts spanning infrastructure, services, and applications.  

• 

LinkedIn, focuses on our services that transform the way customers hire, market, sell, and learn.  

25 

  
•  Gaming,  focuses  on  developing  hardware,  content,  and  services  across  a  large  range  of  platforms  to  help 

grow our user base through game experiences and social interaction.  

Internal  development  allows  us  to  maintain  competitive  advantages  that  come  from  product  differentiation  and  closer 
technical  control  over  our  products  and  services.  It  also  gives  us  the  freedom  to  decide  which  modifications  and 
enhancements  are  most  important  and  when  they  should  be  implemented.  We  strive  to  obtain  information  as  early  as 
possible about changing usage patterns and hardware advances that may affect software and hardware design.  Before 
releasing new software platforms, and as we make significant modifications to existing platforms, we provide application 
vendors with a range of resources and guidelines for development, training, and testing. Generally, we also create product 
documentation internally.  

We protect our intellectual property investments in a variety of ways. We work actively in the U.S. and internationally to 
ensure  the  enforcement  of  copyright,  trademark,  trade  secret,  and  other  protections  that  apply  to  our  software  and 
hardware products, services, business plans, and branding. We are a leader among technology companies in pursuing 
patents  and  currently  have  a  portfolio  of  over  69,000  U.S.  and  international  patents  issued  and  over  19,000  pending 
worldwide.  While  we  employ  much  of  our  internally-developed  intellectual  property  exclusively  in  our  products  and 
services,  we  also  engage  in  outbound  licensing  of  specific  patented  technologies  that  are  incorporated  into  licensees’ 
products. From time to time, we enter into broader cross-license agreements with other technology companies covering 
entire groups of patents. We may also purchase or license technology that we incorporate into our products and services. 
At times, we make select intellectual property broadly available at no or low cost to achieve a strategic objective, such as 
promoting  industry  standards,  advancing  interoperability,  supporting  societal  and/or  environmental  efforts,  or  attracting 
and enabling our external development community. Our increasing engagement with open source software will also cause 
us to license our intellectual property rights broadly in certain situations.  

While it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our products, services, 
and  business  methods,  we  believe,  based  upon  past  experience  and  industry  practice,  such  licenses  generally  can  be 
obtained  on  commercially  reasonable  terms.  We  believe  our  continuing  research  and  product  development  are  not 
materially  dependent  on  any  single  license  or  other  agreement  with  a  third  party  relating  to  the  development  of  our 
products.  

Investing in the Future  

Our success is based on our ability to create new and compelling products, services, and experiences for our users, to 
initiate  and  embrace  disruptive  technology  trends,  to  enter  new  geographic  and  product  markets,  and  to  drive  broad 
adoption of our products and services. We invest in  a range of emerging  technology trends  and breakthroughs  that we 
believe  offer  significant  opportunities  to  deliver  value  to  our  customers  and  growth  for  the  Company.  Based  on  our 
assessment of key technology trends, we maintain our long-term commitment to research and development across a wide 
spectrum of technologies, tools, and platforms spanning digital work and life experiences, cloud computing, AI, devices, 
and operating systems.  

While  our  main  product  research  and  development  facilities  are  located  in  Redmond,  Washington,  we  also  operate 
research and development facilities in other parts of the U.S. and around the world. This global approach helps us remain 
competitive in local markets and enables us to continue to attract top talent from across the world.  

We plan to continue to make significant investments in a broad range of product research and development activities, and 
as  appropriate  we  will  coordinate  our  research  and  development  across  operating  segments  and  leverage  the  results 
across the Company. 

In addition to our main research and development operations, we also operate Microsoft Research. Microsoft Research is 
one of the world’s largest corporate research organizations and works in close collaboration with top universities around 
the world to advance the state-of-the-art in computer science and a broad range of other disciplines, providing us a unique 
perspective on future trends and contributing to our innovation.

DISTRIBUTION, SALES, AND MARKETING  

We market and distribute our products and services through the following channels: OEMs,  direct, and distributors and 
resellers.  Our  sales  force  performs  a  variety  of  functions,  including  working  directly  with  commercial  enterprises  and 
public-sector  organizations  worldwide  to  identify  and  meet  their  technology  and  digital  transformation  requirements; 
managing OEM relationships; and supporting system integrators, independent software vendors, and other partners who 
engage directly with our customers to perform sales, consulting, and fulfillment functions for our products and services.  

OEMs  

We distribute our products and services through OEMs that pre-install our software on new devices and servers they sell. 
The largest component of the OEM business is the Windows operating system pre-installed on devices. OEMs also sell 
devices pre-installed with other Microsoft products and services, including applications such as Office and the capability to 
subscribe to Office 365.  

There are two broad categories of OEMs. The largest category of OEMs are direct OEMs as our relationship with them is 
managed through a direct agreement between Microsoft and the OEM. We have distribution agreements covering one or 
more  of  our  products  with  virtually  all  the  multinational  OEMs,  including  Dell,  Hewlett-Packard,  Lenovo,  and  with  many 
regional  and  local  OEMs. The  second  broad  category  of  OEMs  are  system  builders  consisting  of  lower-volume  PC 
manufacturers, which source Microsoft software for pre-installation and local redistribution primarily through the Microsoft 
distributor channel rather than through a direct agreement or relationship with Microsoft.  

Direct  

Many organizations that license our products  and services transact directly with us through Enterprise Agreements and 
Enterprise Services contracts, with sales support from system integrators, independent software vendors, web agencies, 
and partners that advise organizations on licensing our products and services (“Enterprise Agreement Software Advisors” 
or “ESA”). Microsoft offers direct sales programs targeted to reach small, medium, and corporate customers, in addition to 
those offered through the reseller channel. A large network of partner advisors support many of these sales.  

We also sell commercial and consumer products and services directly to customers, such as cloud services, search, and 
gaming, through  our  digital  marketplaces  and  online stores. In fiscal year 2021, we closed  our Microsoft Store  physical 
locations and opened our Microsoft Experience Centers. Microsoft Experience Centers are designed to facilitate deeper 
engagement with our partners and customers across industries.  

Distributors and Resellers  

Organizations  also  license  our  products  and  services  indirectly,  primarily  through  licensing  solution  partners  (“LSP”), 
distributors, value-added resellers (“VAR”), and retailers. Although each type of reselling partner may reach organizations 
of all sizes, LSPs are primarily engaged with large organizations, distributors resell primarily to VARs, and VARs typically 
reach small and medium organizations. ESAs are also typically authorized as LSPs and operate as resellers for our other 
volume licensing programs. Microsoft Cloud Solution Provider is our main partner program for reselling cloud services.  

We  distribute  our  retail  packaged  products  primarily  through  independent  non-exclusive  distributors,  authorized 
replicators,  resellers,  and  retail  outlets.  Individual  consumers  obtain  these  products  primarily  through  retail  outlets.  We 
distribute  our  devices  through  third-party  retailers.  We  have  a  network  of  field  sales  representatives  and  field  support 
personnel that solicit orders from distributors and resellers and provide product training and sales support.  

Our Dynamics business solutions are also licensed to enterprises through a global network of channel partners providing 
vertical solutions and specialized services.  

27 

  
LICENSING OPTIONS  

We offer options for organizations that want to purchase our cloud services, on-premises software, and SA. We license 
software  to  organizations  under  volume  licensing  agreements  to  allow  the  customer  to  acquire  multiple  licenses  of 
products and services instead of having to acquire separate licenses through retail channels. We use different programs 
designed to provide flexibility for organizations of various sizes. While these programs may differ in various parts of the 
world, generally they include those discussed below.  

SA conveys rights to new software and upgrades for perpetual licenses released over the contract period. It also provides 
support, tools, training, and other licensing benefits to help customers deploy and use software efficiently. SA is included 
with certain volume licensing agreements and is an optional purchase with others.  

Volume Licensing Programs  

Enterprise Agreement  

Enterprise Agreements offer large organizations a manageable volume licensing program that gives them the flexibility to 
buy cloud services and software licenses under one agreement. Enterprise Agreements are designed for medium or large 
organizations that want to license cloud services and on-premises software  organization-wide over  a three-year  period. 
Organizations can elect to purchase perpetual licenses or subscribe to licenses. SA is included.  

Microsoft Customer Agreement  

A Microsoft Customer Agreement is a simplified purchase agreement presented, accepted, and stored through a digital 
experience. A Microsoft Customer Agreement is a non-expiring agreement that is designed to support all customers over 
time, whether purchasing through a partner or directly from Microsoft.  

Microsoft Online Subscription Agreement  

A  Microsoft  Online  Subscription  Agreement  is  designed  for  small  and  medium  organizations  that  want  to  subscribe  to, 
activate, provision, and maintain cloud services seamlessly and directly via the web. The agreement allows customers to 
acquire monthly or annual subscriptions for cloud-based services.  

Microsoft Products and Services Agreement  

Microsoft Products and Services Agreements are designed for medium and large organizations that want to license cloud 
services  and  on-premises  software  as  needed,  with  no  organization-wide  commitment,  under  a  single,  non-expiring 
agreement.  Organizations  purchase  perpetual  licenses  or  subscribe  to  licenses.  SA  is  optional  for  customers  that 
purchase perpetual licenses.  

Open Value  

Open Value agreements  are a simple, cost-effective way to acquire the latest  Microsoft technology. These  agreements 
are  designed for small and  medium organizations that  want to license cloud services and  on-premises software over a 
three-year period. Under Open Value agreements, organizations can elect to purchase perpetual licenses or subscribe to 
licenses and SA is included.  

Select Plus  

A Select Plus agreement is designed for government and academic organizations to acquire on-premises licenses at any 
affiliate or department level, while realizing advantages  as one organization. Organizations purchase perpetual licenses 
and SA is optional.  

28 

  
Partner Programs  

The Microsoft Cloud Solution Provider program offers customers an easy way to license the cloud services they need in 
combination  with  the  value-added  services  offered  by  their  systems  integrator,  managed  services  provider,  or  cloud 
reseller  partner.  Partners  in  this  program  can  easily  package  their  own  products  and  services  to  directly  provision, 
manage, and support their customer subscriptions.  

The Microsoft Services Provider License Agreement allows hosting service providers and independent software vendors 
who want to license eligible Microsoft software products to provide software services and hosted applications to their end 
customers. Partners license software over a three-year period and are billed monthly based on consumption.  

The  Independent  Software  Vendor  Royalty  program  enables  partners  to  integrate  Microsoft  products  into  other 
applications and then license the unified business solution to their end users.  

CUSTOMERS  

Our  customers  include  individual  consumers,  small  and  medium  organizations,  large  global  enterprises,  public-sector 
institutions, Internet service providers, application developers, and OEMs. Our  practice is to ship our  products  promptly 
upon receipt of purchase orders from customers; consequently, backlog is not significant.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND  
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

The  following  Management’s  Discussion  and  Analysis  of  Financial  Condition  and  Results  of  Operations  (“MD&A”)  is 
intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of Microsoft Corporation. MD&A is 
provided  as  a  supplement  to,  and  should  be  read  in  conjunction  with,  our  consolidated  financial  statements  and  the 
accompanying  Notes  to  Financial  Statements  in  our  fiscal  year  2022  Form  10-K.  This  section  generally  discusses  the 
results of our operations for the year ended June 30, 2022 compared to the year ended June 30, 2021. For a discussion 
of the year ended June 30, 2021 compared to the year ended June 30, 2020, please refer to in our fiscal year 2022 Form 
10-K, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on 
Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2021.  

OVERVIEW  

Microsoft is a technology company whose mission is to  empower every person  and every organization on the planet to 
achieve more. We strive to create local opportunity, growth, and impact in every country around the world. Our platforms 
and tools help drive small business productivity, large business competitiveness, and public-sector efficiency. They also 
support new startups, improve educational and health outcomes, and empower human ingenuity.  

We generate revenue by offering a wide range of cloud-based and other services to people and businesses; licensing and 
supporting  an  array  of  software  products;  designing,  manufacturing,  and  selling  devices;  and  delivering  relevant  online 
advertising  to  a  global  audience.  Our  most  significant  expenses  are  related  to  compensating  employees;  designing, 
manufacturing, marketing, and selling our products and services; datacenter costs in support of our cloud-based services; 
and income taxes.  

Highlights from fiscal year 2022 compared with fiscal year 2021 included:  

•  Microsoft Cloud (formerly commercial cloud) revenue increased 32% to $91.2 billion.  

•  Office  Commercial  products  and  cloud  services  revenue  increased  13%  driven  by  Office  365  Commercial 

growth of 18%.  

•  Office  Consumer  products  and  cloud  services  revenue  increased  11%  and  Microsoft  365  Consumer 

subscribers grew to 59.7 million.

Industry Trends  

Our industry is dynamic and highly competitive, with frequent changes in both technologies and business models. Each 
industry shift is an opportunity to conceive new products, new technologies, or new ideas that can further transform the 
industry and our business. At Microsoft, we push the boundaries of what is possible through a broad range of research 
and  development  activities  that  seek  to  identify  and  address  the  changing  demands  of  customers  and  users,  industry 
trends, and competitive forces.  

Economic Conditions, Challenges, and Risks  

The  markets  for  software,  devices,  and  cloud-based  services  are  dynamic  and  highly  competitive.  Our  competitors  are 
developing  new  software  and  devices,  while  also  deploying  competing  cloud-based  services  for  consumers  and 
businesses.  The devices  and  form factors customers prefer evolve rapidly, and influence  how users access services in 
the cloud, and in some cases, the user’s choice of which suite of cloud-based services to use. We must continue to evolve 
and adapt over an extended time in pace with this changing environment. The investments we are making in infrastructure 
and devices will continue to increase our operating costs and may decrease our operating margins.  

Our success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. We hire a mix of university and 
industry talent worldwide. We compete for talented individuals globally by offering an exceptional working environment, 
broad customer reach, scale in resources, the ability to grow one’s career across many different products and businesses, 
and competitive compensation and benefits. Aggregate  demand for our software, services, and devices is correlated to 
global macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, which remain dynamic.  

Our devices are primarily manufactured by third-party contract manufacturers, some of which contain certain components 
for which there are very few qualified suppliers. For these components, we have limited near-term flexibility to use other 
manufacturers if  a current vendor  becomes unavailable  or is unable to  meet our requirements. Extended disruptions at 
these  suppliers  and/or  manufacturers  could  lead  to  a  similar  disruption  in  our  ability  to  manufacture  devices  on  time  to 
meet consumer demand.  

Our international operations provide a significant portion of our total revenue and expenses. Many of these revenue and 
expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As a result, changes in foreign exchange rates may 
significantly affect revenue and expenses. Fluctuations in the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies did not have 
a material impact on reported revenue or expenses from our international operations in fiscal year 2022.  

Refer to Risk Factors in our fiscal year 2022 Form 10-K for a discussion of these factors and other risks.  

Seasonality  

Our  revenue  fluctuates  quarterly  and  is  generally  higher  in  the  second  and  fourth  quarters  of  our  fiscal  year.  Second 
quarter revenue is driven by corporate year-end spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending by 
consumers, and fourth quarter revenue is driven by the volume of multi-year on-premises contracts executed during the 
period.  

Reportable Segments  

We report our financial performance  based on the following segments: Productivity and Business Processes,  Intelligent 
Cloud, and More Personal Computing. The segment amounts included in MD&A are presented on a basis consistent with 
our internal management reporting. Additional information on our reportable segments is contained in Note 19 – Segment 
Information and Geographic Data of the Notes to Financial Statements in our fiscal year 2022 Form 10-K.  

Metrics  

We use metrics in assessing the performance of our business and to make informed decisions regarding the allocation of 
resources. We disclose metrics to enable investors to evaluate progress against our ambitions, provide transparency into 
performance trends, and reflect the continued evolution of our products and services. Our commercial and other business 
metrics are fundamentally connected based on how customers use our products and  

31 

  
services. The metrics are disclosed in the MD&A or the Notes to Financial Statements in our fiscal year 2022 Form 10-K. 
Financial  metrics  are  calculated  based  on  financial  results  prepared  in  accordance  with  accounting  principles  generally 
accepted in  the United States of America (“GAAP”), and growth comparisons relate to the corresponding period of last 
fiscal year.  

In the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, we made updates to the presentation and method of calculation for certain metrics, 
most notably changes to incorporate all current and anticipated revenue streams within our Office Consumer and Server 
products and cloud services metrics and changes to align with how we manage our Windows OEM and Search and news 
advertising businesses. None of these changes had a material impact on previously reported amounts in our MD&A.  

In  the  third  quarter  of  fiscal  year  2022,  we  completed  our  acquisition  of  Nuance.  Nuance  is  included  in  all  commercial 
metrics  and  our  Server  products  and  cloud  services  revenue  growth  metric.  Azure  and  other  cloud  services  revenue 
includes Nuance cloud services, and Server products revenue includes Nuance on-premises offerings.  

Commercial  

Our  commercial  business  primarily  consists  of  Server  products  and  cloud  services,  Office  Commercial,  Windows 
Commercial,  the  commercial  portion  of  LinkedIn,  Enterprise  Services,  and  Dynamics.  Our  commercial  metrics  allow 
management  and  investors  to  assess  the  overall  health  of  our  commercial  business  and  include  leading  indicators  of 
future performance.

•  Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage decreased slightly to 70%. Excluding the impact of the change in 
accounting  estimate,  Microsoft  Cloud  gross  margin  percentage  increased  3  points  driven  by  improvement 
across our cloud services, offset in part by sales mix shift to Azure and other cloud services.  

Operating  expenses  increased  $6.3 billion  or  14%  driven  by  investments  in  cloud  engineering,  LinkedIn,  Gaming,  and 
commercial sales.

Current  year  net  income  and  diluted  EPS  were  positively  impacted  by  the  net  tax  benefit  related  to  the  transfer  of 
intangible properties, which resulted in an increase to net income and diluted EPS of $3.3 billion and $0.44, respectively. 
Prior year net income and diluted EPS were positively impacted by the net tax benefit related to the India Supreme Court 
decision  on  withholding  taxes,  which  resulted  in  an  increase  to  net  income  and  diluted  EPS  of  $620 million  and  $0.08, 
respectively.

We  use  derivative  instruments  to  manage  risks  related  to  foreign  currencies,  equity  prices,  interest  rates,  and  credit; 
enhance  investment  returns;  and  facilitate  portfolio  diversification.  Gains  and  losses  from  changes  in  fair  values  of 
derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments are primarily recognized in other income (expense), net.  

Interest and dividends income decreased due to lower portfolio balances. Interest expense decreased due to a decrease 
in  outstanding  long-term  debt  due  to  debt  maturities.  Net  recognized  gains  on  investments  decreased  primarily  due  to 
lower gains on equity securities.  

Effective Tax Rate  

INCOME TAXES  

Our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2022 and 2021 was 13% and 14%, respectively. The decrease in our effective tax 
rate was primarily due to a $3.3 billion net income tax benefit in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 related to the transfer 
of  intangible  properties,  offset  in  part  by  changes  in  the  mix  of  our  income  before  income  taxes  between  the  U.S.  and 
foreign countries, as well as tax benefits in the prior year from the India Supreme Court decision on withholding taxes in 
the case of Engineering Analysis Centre of Excellent Private Limited vs The Commissioner of Income Tax, an agreement 
between  the  U.S.  and  India  tax  authorities  related  to  transfer  pricing,  and  final  Tax  Cuts  and  Jobs  Act  (“TCJA”) 
regulations.  

In the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, we transferred certain intangible properties from our Puerto Rico subsidiary to the 
U.S. The transfer of intangible properties resulted in a $3.3 billion net income tax benefit in the first quarter of fiscal year 
2022, as the value of future U.S. tax deductions exceeds the current tax liability from the U.S. global intangible low-taxed 
income tax.  

We  have  historically  paid  India  withholding  taxes  on  software  sales  through  distributor  withholding  and  tax  audit 
assessments  in  India.  In  March  2021,  the  India  Supreme  Court  ruled  favorably  for  companies  in  86  separate  appeals, 
some dating back to 2012, holding that software sales are not subject to India withholding taxes. Although we were not a 
party to the  appeals, our software sales in India were determined to be not subject to withholding taxes.  Therefore, we 
recorded a net income tax benefit of $620 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2021 to reflect the results of the India 
Supreme Court decision impacting fiscal year 1996 through fiscal year 2016.  

Our effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate, primarily due to the net income tax benefit related to 
the  transfer  of  intangible  properties,  earnings  taxed  at  lower  rates  in  foreign  jurisdictions  resulting  from  producing  and 
distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations center in Ireland, and tax benefits relating to 
stock-based compensation.

The mix of income before income taxes between the U.S. and foreign countries impacted our effective tax rate as a result 
of  the  geographic  distribution  of,  and  customer  demand  for,  our  products  and  services.  In  fiscal  year  2022,  our  U.S. 
income before income taxes was $47.8 billion and our foreign income before income taxes was $35.9 billion. In fiscal year 
2021,  our  U.S.  income  before  income  taxes  was  $35.0 billion  and  our  foreign  income  before  income  taxes  was 
$36.1 billion.  

Uncertain Tax Positions  

We  settled  a  portion  of  the  Internal  Revenue  Service  (“IRS”)  audit  for  tax  years  2004  to  2006  in  fiscal  year  2011.  In 
February 2012, the IRS withdrew its 2011 Revenue Agents Report related to unresolved issues for tax years 2004 to 2006 
and reopened the audit phase of the examination. We also settled a portion of the IRS audit for tax years 2007 to 2009 in 
fiscal year 2016, and a portion of the IRS audit for tax years 2010 to 2013 in fiscal year 2018. In the second quarter of 
fiscal year 2021, we settled an  additional portion  of the  IRS audits for tax years 2004 to 2013 and made  a payment of 
$1.7 billion, including tax and interest. We remain under audit for tax years 2004 to 2017.  

As  of  June 30,  2022,  the  primary  unresolved  issues  for  the  IRS  audits  relate  to  transfer  pricing,  which  could  have  a 
material  impact  in  our  consolidated  financial  statements  when  the  matters  are  resolved.  We  believe  our  allowances  for 
income tax contingencies are adequate. We have not received a proposed assessment  for  the  unresolved key transfer 
pricing  issues  and  do  not  expect  a  final  resolution  of  these  issues  in  the  next  12  months. Based  on  the  information 
currently available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our tax contingencies for these issues within 
the next 12 months.  

We are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U.S. Our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject 
to examination for tax years 1996 to 2021, some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. The resolution 
of each of these audits is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements.  

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES  

Adjusted  net  income  and  adjusted  diluted  EPS  are  non-GAAP  financial  measures  which  exclude  the  net tax  benefit 
related to the transfer of intangible properties in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 and the net income tax benefit related 
to an India Supreme Court decision on withholding taxes in the third quarter of fiscal year 2021. We believe these non-
GAAP  measures  aid  investors  by  providing  additional  insight  into  our  operational  performance  and  help  clarify  trends 
affecting  our  business.  For  comparability  of  reporting,  management  considers  non-GAAP  measures  in  conjunction  with 
GAAP financial results in evaluating business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures presented should not be 
considered a substitute for, or superior to, the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  

We  expect  existing  cash,  cash  equivalents,  short-term  investments,  cash  flows  from  operations,  and  access  to  capital 
markets  to  continue  to  be  sufficient  to  fund  our  operating  activities  and  cash  commitments  for  investing  and  financing 
activities,  such  as  dividends,  share  repurchases,  debt  maturities,  material  capital  expenditures,  and  the  transition  tax 
related to the TCJA, for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.  

Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Investments  

Cash,  cash  equivalents,  and  short-term  investments  totaled  $104.8 billion  and  $130.3 billion  as  of  June 30,  2022  and 
2021, respectively. Equity investments were $6.9 billion and $6.0 billion as of June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our 
short-term investments are primarily intended to facilitate liquidity and capital preservation. They consist predominantly of 
highly  liquid  investment-grade  fixed-income  securities,  diversified  among  industries  and  individual  issuers.  The 
investments  are  predominantly  U.S.  dollar-denominated  securities,  but  also  include  foreign  currency-denominated 
securities to diversify risk. Our fixed-income investments are exposed to interest rate risk and credit risk. The credit risk 
and  average  maturity  of  our  fixed-income  portfolio  are  managed  to  achieve  economic  returns  that  correlate  to  certain 
fixed-income  indices.  The  settlement  risk  related  to  these  investments  is  insignificant  given  that  the  short-term 
investments held are primarily highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities.  

Valuation  

In general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine the  
fair  value  of  our  financial  instruments.  This  pricing  methodology  applies  to  our  Level 1  investments,  such  as  U.S. 
government  securities,  common  and  preferred  stock,  and  mutual  funds.  If  quoted  prices  in  active  markets  for  identical 
assets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value, then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or 
inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly. This pricing methodology applies to our 
Level 2 investments, such as commercial paper, certificates of deposit, U.S. agency securities, foreign government bonds, 
mortgage-  and  asset-backed  securities,  corporate  notes  and  bonds,  and  municipal  securities.  Level 3  investments  are 
valued  using  internally-developed  models  with  unobservable  inputs.  Assets  and  liabilities  measured  at  fair  value  on  a 
recurring basis using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio.  

A  majority  of  our  investments  are  priced  by  pricing  vendors  and  are  generally  Level 1  or  Level 2  investments  as  these 
vendors  either  provide  a  quoted  market  price  in  an  active  market  or  use  observable  inputs  for  their  pricing  without 
applying significant adjustments. Broker pricing is used mainly when a quoted price is not available, the investment is not 
priced by our pricing vendors, or when a broker price is more reflective of fair values in the market in which the investment 
trades.  Our  broker-priced  investments  are  generally  classified  as  Level 2  investments  because  the  broker  prices  these 
investments  based  on  similar  assets  without  applying  significant  adjustments.  In  addition,  all  our  broker-priced 
investments have  a sufficient level of trading volume to  demonstrate  that the fair values  used  are  appropriate for these 
investments. Our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded. 
These  controls  include  model  validation,  review  of  key  model  inputs,  analysis  of  period-over-period  fluctuations,  and 
independent recalculation of prices where appropriate.

Cash  from  operations  increased  $12.3 billion  to  $89.0 billion  for  fiscal  year  2022,  mainly  due  to  an  increase  in  cash 
received from customers, offset in part by an increase in cash paid to suppliers and employees. Cash used in financing 
increased  $10.4 billion  to  $58.9 billion  for  fiscal  year  2022,  mainly  due  to  a  $5.3 billion  increase  in  common  stock 
repurchases  and  a  $5.3 billion  increase  in  repayments  of  debt.  Cash  used  in  investing  increased  $2.7 billion  to 
$30.3 billion for fiscal year 2022, mainly due to a $13.1 billion increase in cash used for acquisitions of companies, net of 
cash  acquired,  and  purchases  of  intangible  and  other  assets,  and  a  $3.3 billion  increase  in  additions  to  property  and 
equipment, offset in part by a $15.6 billion increase in cash from net investment purchases, sales, and maturities.

Debt Proceeds  

We issue debt to take advantage of favorable pricing and liquidity in the debt markets, reflecting our credit rating and the 
low  interest  rate  environment.  The  proceeds  of  these  issuances  were  or  will  be  used  for  general  corporate  purposes, 
which  may  include,  among  other  things,  funding  for  working  capital,  capital  expenditures,  repurchases  of  capital  stock, 
acquisitions, and repayment of existing debt. In March 2021 and June 2020, we exchanged a portion of our existing debt 
at  a  premium  for  cash  and  new  debt  with  longer  maturities  to  take  advantage  of  favorable  financing  rates  in  the  debt 
markets,  reflecting  our  credit  rating  and  the  low  interest  rate  environment.  Refer  to  Note  11  –  Debt  of  the  Notes  to 
Financial Statements in our fiscal year 2022 Form 10-K for further discussion.  

Unearned Revenue  

Unearned  revenue  comprises  mainly  unearned  revenue  related  to  volume  licensing  programs,  which  may  include 
Software Assurance (“SA”) and cloud services. Unearned revenue is generally invoiced annually at the beginning of each 
contract  period  for  multi-year  agreements  and  recognized  ratably  over  the  coverage  period.  Unearned  revenue  also 
includes payments for other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we transfer 
control of the product or service. Refer to Note 1 – Accounting Policies of the Notes to Financial Statements in our fiscal 
year 2022 Form 10-K for further discussion.  

The following table outlines the expected future recognition of unearned revenue as of June 30, 2022:

If our customers choose to license cloud-based versions of our products and services rather than licensing transaction-
based  products  and  services,  the  associated  revenue  will  shift  from  being  recognized  at  the  time  of  the  transaction  to 
being recognized over the subscription period or upon consumption, as applicable.

Income Taxes  

As a result of the TCJA, we are required to pay a one-time transition tax on deferred foreign income not previously subject 
to U.S. income tax. Under the TCJA, the transition tax is payable in interest-free installments over eight years,  with 8% 
due in each of the first five years, 15% in year six, 20% in year seven, and 25% in year eight. We have paid transition tax 
of $6.2 billion, which included $1.5 billion for fiscal year 2022. The remaining transition tax of $12.0 billion is payable over 
the next four years, with $1.3 billion payable within 12 months.  

Provisions enacted in the TCJA related  to the capitalization for tax purposes  of research and  experimental expenditures 
became effective on July 1, 2022. These provisions require us to capitalize research and experimental expenditures and 
amortize  them  on  the  U.S.  tax  return  over  five  or  fifteen  years,  depending  on  where  research  is  conducted.  The  final 
foreign  tax  credit  regulations,  also  effective  on  July 1,  2022,  introduced  significant  changes  to  foreign  tax  credit 
calculations in the U.S. tax return. While these provisions are not expected to have a material impact on our fiscal year 
2023 effective tax rate on a net basis, our cash paid for taxes would increase unless these provisions are postponed or 
modified through legislative processes.  

Share Repurchases  

During  fiscal  years  2022  and  2021,  we  repurchased  95 million  shares  and  101 million  shares  of  our  common  stock  for 
$28.0 billion  and  $23.0 billion,  respectively,  through  our  share  repurchase  programs.  All  repurchases  were  made  using 
cash resources. As of June 30, 2022, $40.7 billion remained of our $60 billion share repurchase program. Refer to Note 
16 – Stockholders’ Equity of the Notes to Financial Statements in our fiscal year 2022 Form 10-K for further discussion.  

Dividends  

During  fiscal  year  2022,  our  Board  of  Directors  declared  quarterly  dividends  of  $0.62  per  share.  We  intend  to  continue 
returning capital to shareholders in the form of dividends, subject to declaration by our Board of Directors. Refer to Note 
16 – Stockholders’ Equity of the Notes to Financial Statements in our fiscal year 2022 Form 10-K for further discussion.  

Other Planned Uses of Capital  

On January 18, 2022, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Activision Blizzard, Inc. (“Activision Blizzard”) for 
$95.00  per  share  in  an  all-cash  transaction  valued  at  $68.7 billion,  inclusive  of  Activision  Blizzard’s  net  cash.  The 
acquisition has been approved by Activision Blizzard’s shareholders, and we expect it to close in fiscal year 2023, subject 
to the satisfaction of certain regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.  

We  will  continue  to  invest  in  sales,  marketing,  product  support  infrastructure,  and  existing  and  advanced  areas  of 
technology,  as  well  as  continue  making  acquisitions  that  align  with  our  business  strategy.  Additions  to  property  and 
equipment will continue, including new facilities, datacenters, and computer systems for research and development, sales 
and marketing, support, and administrative staff. We expect capital expenditures to increase in coming years to support 
growth  in  our  cloud  offerings.  We  have  operating  and  finance  leases  for  datacenters,  corporate  offices,  research  and 
development facilities, Microsoft Experience Centers, and certain equipment. We have not engaged in any related party 
transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect 
liquidity or the availability of capital resources.

RECENT ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE  

Refer to Note 1 – Accounting Policies of the Notes to Financial Statements in our fiscal year 2022 Form 10-K for further 
discussion.  

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES  

Our  consolidated  financial  statements  and  accompanying  notes  are  prepared  in  accordance  with  GAAP.  Preparing 
consolidated  financial  statements  requires  management  to  make  estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect  the  reported 
amounts  of  assets,  liabilities,  revenue,  and  expenses.  Critical  accounting  estimates  are  those  estimates  that  involve  a 
significant  level  of  estimation  uncertainty  and  could  have  a  material  impact  on  our  financial  condition  or  results  of 
operations.  We  have  critical  accounting  estimates  in  the  areas  of  revenue  recognition,  impairment  of  investment 
securities, goodwill, research and development costs, legal and other contingencies, income taxes, and inventories.  

Revenue Recognition  

Our  contracts  with  customers  often  include  promises  to  transfer  multiple  products  and  services  to  a  customer. 
Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for 
separately  versus  together  may  require  significant  judgment.  When  a  cloud-based  service  includes  both  on-premises 
software  licenses  and  cloud  services,  judgment  is  required  to  determine  whether  the  software  license  is  considered 
distinct  and  accounted  for  separately,  or  not  distinct  and  accounted  for  together  with  the  cloud  service  and  recognized 
over time. Certain cloud services, primarily Office 365, depend on a significant level of integration, interdependency, and 
interrelation  between  the  desktop  applications  and  cloud  services,  and  are  accounted  for  together  as  one  performance 
obligation. Revenue from Office 365 is recognized ratably over the period in which the cloud services are provided.  

Judgment is required to determine the stand-alone selling price (“SSP”) for each distinct performance obligation. We use 
a single amount to estimate SSP for items that are not  sold separately, including  on-premises licenses sold with SA or 
software updates provided at no additional charge. We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP when we sell each of the 
products and services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative 
SSP of the various products and services.  

In  instances  where  SSP  is  not  directly  observable,  such  as  when  we  do  not  sell  the  product  or  service  separately,  we 
determine the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We typically have 
more  than  one  SSP  for  individual  products  and  services  due  to  the  stratification  of  those  products  and  services  by 
customers  and  circumstances.  In  these  instances,  we  may  use  information  such  as  the  size  of  the  customer  and 
geographic region in determining the SSP.  

Due to the various benefits from and the nature of our SA program, judgment is required to assess the pattern of delivery, 
including the exercise pattern of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers.  

Our products are generally sold with a right of return, we may provide other credits or incentives, and in certain instances 
we  estimate  customer  usage  of  our  products  and  services,  which  are  accounted  for  as  variable  consideration  when 
determining the amount of revenue to recognize. Returns and credits are estimated at contract inception and updated at 
the  end  of  each  reporting  period  if  additional  information  becomes  available.  Changes  to  our  estimated  variable 
consideration were not material for the periods presented.  

Impairment of Investment Securities  

We review debt investments quarterly for credit losses and impairment. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, 
we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, and the extent to 
which the fair value is less than cost. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this  

42 

  
judgment,  we  employ  a  systematic  methodology  that  considers  available  quantitative  and  qualitative  evidence  in 
evaluating  potential  impairment  of  our  investments.  In  addition,  we  consider  specific  adverse  conditions  related  to  the 
financial health of, and business outlook for, the investee. If we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than  not 
that  we  will  be  required  to  sell  the  security  before  recovery,  then  a  decline  in  fair  value  below  cost  is  recorded  as  an 
impairment  charge  in  other  income  (expense),  net  and  a  new  cost  basis  in  the  investment  is  established.  If  market, 
industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments.  

Equity  investments  without  readily  determinable  fair  values  are  written  down  to  fair  value  if  a  qualitative  assessment 
indicates that the investment is impaired  and the fair value of the investment is less than carrying value. We  perform a 
qualitative assessment on a periodic basis. We are required to estimate the fair value of the investment to determine the 
amount  of the impairment loss. Once an investment is determined to be impaired,  an impairment charge is recorded in 
other income (expense), net.  

Goodwill  

We allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination. We 
evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and, if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation 
approach. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating 
segment) on an annual basis (May 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that 
would  more  likely  than  not  reduce  the  fair  value  of  a  reporting  unit  below  its  carrying  value.  These  events  or 
circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, 
competition, or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit.  

Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of 
assets  and  liabilities  to  reporting  units,  assignment  of  goodwill  to  reporting  units,  and  determination  of  the  fair  value  of 
each reporting unit. The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated primarily through the use of a discounted cash flow 
methodology. This analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent 
on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which 
cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital.  

The  estimates used to calculate the fair value of a  reporting unit change from year to year based on  operating  results, 
market  conditions,  and  other  factors.  Changes  in  these  estimates  and  assumptions  could  materially  affect  the 
determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit.  

Research and Development Costs  

Costs  incurred  internally  in  researching  and  developing  a  computer  software  product  are  charged  to  expense  until 
technological feasibility has been established for the product. Once technological feasibility is established, software costs 
are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. Judgment is required in determining when 
technological  feasibility  of  a  product  is  established.  We  have  determined  that  technological  feasibility  for  our  software 
products is reached after all high-risk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing. Generally, this 
occurs  shortly  before  the  products  are  released  to  production.  The  amortization  of  these  costs  is  included  in  cost  of 
revenue over the estimated life of the products.  

Legal and Other Contingencies       

The outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. An estimated loss 
from a loss contingency such as a legal  proceeding or  claim is accrued by a charge  to income if it is probable that an 
asset  has  been  impaired  or  a  liability  has  been  incurred  and  the  amount  of  the  loss  can  be  reasonably  estimated.  In 
determining  whether  a  loss  should  be  accrued  we  evaluate,  among  other  factors,  the  degree  of  probability  of  an 
unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. Changes in these factors could 
materially impact our consolidated financial statements.  

43 

Income Taxes  

The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current 
year, and deferred tax liabilities and assets  for the future tax consequences of  events  that  have been  recognized in an 
entity’s financial statements or tax returns. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more 
likely  than  not  that  the  tax  position  will  be  sustained  on  examination  by  the  taxing  authorities,  based  on  the  technical 
merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on 
the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Accounting literature 
also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of deferred income tax assets 
and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, and income tax disclosures. Judgment is 
required  in  assessing  the  future  tax  consequences  of  events  that  have  been  recognized  in  our  consolidated  financial 
statements or tax returns. Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our 
consolidated financial statements.  

Inventories  

Inventories are stated at average cost, subject to the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost includes materials, labor, 
and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. Net realizable value is the estimated 
selling price less estimated costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. We regularly review inventory quantities on 
hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our inventory. These reviews include 
analysis of demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans, current sales levels, pricing strategy, 
and component cost trends. If our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a 
new cost basis through a charge to cost of revenue.  

CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING ESTIMATE  

In July 2022, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our server and network equipment. Due to investments in 
software  that  increased  efficiencies  in  how  we  operate  our  server  and  network  equipment,  as  well  as  advances  in 
technology, we determined we should increase the estimated useful lives of both server and network equipment from four 
years to six years. This change in accounting estimate will be effective beginning fiscal year 2023. Based on the carrying 
amount of server and network equipment included in property and equipment, net as of June 30, 2022, it is estimated this 
change  will  increase  our  fiscal  year  2023  operating  income  by  $3.7 billion.  We  had  previously  increased  the  estimated 
useful lives of both server and network equipment in July 2020.

STATEMENT OF MANAGEMENT’S RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

Management is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related information that are 
presented in this report. The consolidated financial statements, which include amounts based on management’s estimates 
and judgments, have been prepared in conformity with  accounting  principles  generally accepted in the United States of 
America.  

The  Company  designs  and  maintains  accounting  and  internal  control  systems  to  provide  reasonable  assurance  at 
reasonable  cost  that  assets  are  safeguarded  against  loss  from  unauthorized  use  or  disposition,  and  that  the  financial 
records  are  reliable  for  preparing  consolidated  financial  statements  and  maintaining  accountability  for  assets.  These 
systems  are  augmented  by  written  policies,  an  organizational  structure  providing  division  of  responsibilities,  careful 
selection and training of qualified personnel, and a program of internal audits.  

The Company engaged Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, to audit and render an 
opinion  on  the  consolidated  financial  statements  and  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  in  accordance  with  the 
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  

The Board of Directors,  through its Audit Committee, consisting solely of independent directors of the Company, meets 
periodically  with  management,  internal  auditors,  and  our  independent  registered  public  accounting  firm  to  ensure  that 
each is meeting its responsibilities and to discuss matters concerning internal controls and financial reporting. Deloitte & 
Touche LLP and the internal auditors each have full and free access to the Audit Committee.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  

RISKS  

We  are  exposed  to  economic  risk  from  foreign  exchange  rates,  interest  rates,  credit  risk,  and  equity  prices.  We  use 
derivatives instruments to manage these risks, however, they may still impact our consolidated financial statements.  

Foreign Currencies  

Certain  forecasted  transactions,  assets,  and  liabilities  are  exposed  to  foreign  currency  risk.  We  monitor  our  foreign 
currency  exposures  daily  to  maximize  the  economic  effectiveness  of  our  foreign  currency  positions,  including  hedges. 
Principal currency exposures include the Euro, Japanese yen, British pound, Canadian dollar, and Australian dollar.  

Interest Rate  

Securities  held  in  our  fixed-income  portfolio  are  subject  to  different  interest  rate  risks  based  on  their  maturities.  We 
manage  the  average  maturity  of  the  fixed-income  portfolio  to  achieve  economic  returns  that  correlate  to  certain  global 
fixed-income indices.  

Credit  

Our  fixed-income  portfolio  is  diversified  and  consists  primarily  of  investment-grade  securities.  We  manage  credit 
exposures relative to broad-based indices and to facilitate portfolio diversification.  

Equity  

Securities held in our equity investments portfolio are subject to price risk.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

NOTE 1 — ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

Accounting Principles  

Our  consolidated  financial  statements  and  accompanying  notes  are  prepared  in  accordance  with  accounting  principles 
generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”).  

We  have  recast  certain  prior  period  amounts  to  conform  to  the  current  period  presentation.  The  recast  of  these  prior 
period  amounts  had  no  impact  on  our  consolidated  balance  sheets,  consolidated  income  statements,  or  consolidated 
cash flows statements.  

Principles of Consolidation  

The  consolidated  financial  statements  include  the  accounts  of  Microsoft  Corporation  and  its  subsidiaries.  Intercompany 
transactions and balances have been eliminated.  

Estimates and Assumptions  

Preparing  financial  statements  requires  management  to  make  estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect  the  reported 
amounts  of  assets,  liabilities,  revenue,  and  expenses.  Examples  of  estimates  and  assumptions  include:  for  revenue 
recognition, determining the nature and timing of satisfaction of performance obligations, and determining the standalone 
selling price (“SSP”) of performance obligations, variable consideration, and other obligations such as product returns and 
refunds;  loss  contingencies;  product  warranties;  the  fair  value  of  and/or  potential  impairment  of  goodwill  and  intangible 
assets for our reporting units; product life cycles; useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets; allowances for doubtful 
accounts;  the  market  value  of,  and  demand  for,  our  inventory;  stock-based  compensation  forfeiture  rates;  when 
technological  feasibility  is  achieved  for  our  products;  the  potential  outcome  of  uncertain  tax  positions  that  have  been 
recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns; and determining the timing and amount of impairments 
for investments. Actual results and outcomes may differ from management’s estimates and assumptions due to risks and 
uncertainties.  

In July 2022, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our server and network equipment. Due to investments in 
software  that  increased  efficiencies  in  how  we  operate  our  server  and  network  equipment,  as  well  as  advances  in 
technology, we determined we should increase the estimated useful lives of both server and network equipment from four 
years  to  six  years.  This  change  in  accounting  estimate  will  be  effective  beginning  fiscal  year  2023.  We  had  previously 
increased the estimated useful lives of both server and network equipment in July 2020.  

Foreign Currencies  

Assets  and  liabilities  recorded  in  foreign  currencies  are  translated  at  the  exchange  rate  on  the  balance  sheet  date. 
Revenue and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. Translation adjustments 
resulting from this process are recorded to other comprehensive income.  

Revenue  

Product Revenue and Service and Other Revenue  

Product  revenue  includes  sales  from  operating  systems,  cross-device  productivity  applications,  server  applications, 
business  solution  applications,  desktop  and  server  management  tools,  software  development  tools,  video  games,  and 
hardware such as PCs, tablets, gaming and entertainment consoles, other intelligent devices, and related accessories.  

52 

Service  and  other  revenue  includes  sales  from  cloud-based  solutions  that  provide  customers  with  software,  services, 
platforms,  and  content  such  as  Office  365,  Azure,  Dynamics  365,  and  Xbox;  solution  support;  and  consulting  services. 
Service and other revenue also includes sales from online advertising and LinkedIn.  

Revenue Recognition  

Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects 
the  consideration  we  expect  to  receive  in  exchange  for  those  products  or  services.  We  enter  into  contracts  that  can 
include various combinations of products and services, which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as 
separate  performance  obligations.  Revenue  is  recognized  net  of  allowances  for  returns  and  any  taxes  collected  from 
customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.  

Nature of Products and Services  

Licenses for on-premises software provide the customer with a right to use the software as it exists when made available 
to the customer. Customers may purchase perpetual licenses or subscribe to licenses, which provide customers with the 
same  functionality  and  differ  mainly  in  the  duration  over  which  the  customer  benefits  from  the  software.  Revenue  from 
distinct  on-premises  licenses  is  recognized  upfront  at  the  point  in  time  when  the  software  is  made  available  to  the 
customer.  In  cases  where  we  allocate  revenue  to  software  updates,  primarily  because  the  updates  are  provided  at  no 
additional charge, revenue is recognized as the updates are provided, which is generally ratably over the estimated life of 
the related device or license.  

Certain  volume  licensing  programs,  including  Enterprise  Agreements,  include  on-premises  licenses  combined  with 
Software  Assurance  (“SA”).  SA  conveys  rights  to  new  software  and  upgrades  released  over  the  contract  period  and 
provides support, tools, and training to help customers  deploy  and use products  more efficiently.  On-premises licenses 
are  considered  distinct  performance  obligations  when  sold  with  SA.  Revenue  allocated  to  SA  is  generally  recognized 
ratably  over  the  contract  period  as  customers  simultaneously  consume  and  receive  benefits,  given  that  SA  comprises 
distinct performance obligations that are satisfied over time.  

Cloud services, which allow customers to use hosted software over the contract period without taking possession of the 
software, are provided on  either a subscription  or consumption  basis. Revenue related  to cloud services provided on  a 
subscription  basis  is  recognized  ratably  over  the  contract  period.  Revenue  related  to  cloud  services  provided  on  a 
consumption basis, such as the amount of storage used in a period, is recognized  based  on the customer utilization of 
such resources. When cloud services require a significant level of integration and interdependency with software and the 
individual components are not considered distinct, all revenue is recognized over the period in which the cloud services 
are provided.  

Revenue from search advertising is recognized when the advertisement appears in the search results or when the action 
necessary  to  earn  the  revenue  has  been  completed.  Revenue  from  consulting  services  is  recognized  as  services  are 
provided.  

Our  hardware  is  generally  highly  dependent  on,  and  interrelated  with,  the  underlying  operating  system  and  cannot 
function without the operating system. In these cases, the hardware and software license are accounted for as  a single 
performance  obligation  and  revenue  is  recognized  at  the  point  in  time  when  ownership  is  transferred  to  resellers  or 
directly to end customers through retail stores and online marketplaces.  

Refer  to  Note  19  –  Segment  Information  and  Geographic  Data  for  further  information,  including  revenue  by  significant 
product and service offering.  

Significant Judgments  

Our  contracts  with  customers  often  include  promises  to  transfer  multiple  products  and  services  to  a  customer. 
Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be  

53 

  
accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. When a cloud-based service includes both on-
premises  software  licenses  and  cloud  services,  judgment  is  required  to  determine  whether  the  software  license  is 
considered  distinct  and  accounted  for  separately,  or  not  distinct  and  accounted  for  together  with  the  cloud  service  and 
recognized  over  time.  Certain  cloud  services,  primarily  Office  365,  depend  on  a  significant  level  of  integration, 
interdependency, and interrelation between the desktop applications and cloud services, and are accounted for together 
as one performance obligation. Revenue from Office 365 is recognized ratably over the period in which the cloud services 
are provided.  

Judgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. We use a single amount to estimate 
SSP for items that are not sold separately, including on-premises licenses sold with SA or software updates provided at 
no  additional  charge.  We  use  a  range  of  amounts  to  estimate  SSP  when  we  sell  each  of  the  products  and  services 
separately and  need  to determine whether there is a discount to  be allocated based on the  relative SSP of the  various 
products and services.  

In  instances  where  SSP  is  not  directly  observable,  such  as  when  we  do  not  sell  the  product  or  service  separately,  we 
determine the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We typically have 
more  than  one  SSP  for  individual  products  and  services  due  to  the  stratification  of  those  products  and  services  by 
customers  and  circumstances.  In  these  instances,  we  may  use  information  such  as  the  size  of  the  customer  and 
geographic region in determining the SSP.  

Due to the various benefits from and the nature of our SA program, judgment is required to assess the pattern of delivery, 
including the exercise pattern of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers.  

Our products are generally sold with a right of return, we may provide other credits or incentives, and in certain instances 
we  estimate  customer  usage  of  our  products  and  services,  which  are  accounted  for  as  variable  consideration  when 
determining the amount of revenue to recognize. Returns and credits are estimated at contract inception and updated at 
the  end  of  each  reporting  period  if  additional  information  becomes  available.  Changes  to  our  estimated  variable 
consideration were not material for the periods presented.  

Contract Balances and Other Receivables  

Timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers. We record a receivable when revenue 
is recognized prior to invoicing, or unearned revenue when revenue is recognized subsequent to invoicing. For multi-year 
agreements,  we  generally  invoice  customers  annually  at  the  beginning  of  each  annual  coverage  period.  We  record  a 
receivable related to revenue recognized for multi-year on-premises licenses as we have an unconditional right to invoice 
and receive payment in the future related to those licenses.  

Unearned revenue comprises mainly unearned revenue related to volume licensing programs, which may include SA and 
cloud services. Unearned  revenue is generally invoiced  annually at  the beginning of each contract  period for  multi-year 
agreements and recognized ratably over the coverage period. Unearned revenue also includes payments for consulting 
services  to  be  performed  in  the  future,  LinkedIn  subscriptions,  Office  365  subscriptions,  Xbox  subscriptions,  Windows 
post-delivery support, Dynamics business solutions, and other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn 
the revenue when we transfer control of the product or service.  

Refer to Note 13  – Unearned Revenue for further information, including unearned revenue by segment and changes in 
unearned revenue during the period.  

Payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms generally include a requirement of payment within 30 
to 60 days. In instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, we have determined 
our contracts generally do not include a significant financing component. The primary purpose of our invoicing terms is to 
provide customers with simplified and predictable ways of purchasing our products and services, not to receive financing 
from our customers or to provide customers with financing. Examples include invoicing at the beginning of a subscription 
term  with  revenue  recognized  ratably  over  the  contract  period,  and  multi-year  on-premises  licenses  that  are  invoiced 
annually with revenue recognized upfront.

As of June 30, 2022 and 2021, other receivables due from suppliers were $1.0 billion and $965 million, respectively, and 
are included in accounts receivable, net in our consolidated balance sheets.  

As of June 30, 2022 and 2021, long-term accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, was $3.8 billion and 
$3.4 billion, respectively, and is included in other long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheets.  

The  allowance  for  doubtful  accounts  reflects  our  best  estimate  of  probable  losses  inherent  in  the  accounts  receivable 
balance.  We  determine  the  allowance  based  on  known  troubled  accounts,  historical  experience,  and  other  currently 
available evidence.

We record financing receivables when we offer certain of our customers the option to acquire our software products and 
services  offerings  through  a  financing  program  in  a  limited  number  of  countries.  As  of  June 30,  2022  and  2021,  our 
financing  receivables,  net  were  $4.1 billion  and  $4.4 billion,  respectively,  for  short-term  and  long-term  financing 
receivables, which are included in other current assets and other long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheets. We 
record  an  allowance  to  cover  expected  losses  based  on  troubled  accounts,  historical  experience,  and  other  currently 
available evidence.  

Assets Recognized from Costs to Obtain a Contract with a Customer  

We recognize an asset for the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if we expect the benefit of those 
costs to be longer than one year. We have determined that certain sales incentive programs meet the requirements to be 
capitalized. Total capitalized costs to obtain a contract were immaterial during the periods presented and are included in 
other current and long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheets.  

We  apply  a  practical  expedient  to  expense  costs  as  incurred  for  costs  to  obtain  a  contract  with  a  customer  when  the 
amortization  period  would  have  been  one  year  or  less.  These  costs  include  our  internal  sales  force  compensation 
program  and  certain  partner  sales  incentive  programs  as  we  have  determined  annual  compensation  is  commensurate 
with annual sales activities.  

Cost of Revenue  

Cost of revenue includes: manufacturing and distribution costs for products sold and programs licensed; operating costs 
related to product support service centers and product distribution centers; costs incurred to include software on PCs sold 
by original equipment manufacturers (“OEM”), to drive traffic to our websites, and to acquire online

advertising  space;  costs  incurred  to  support  and  maintain  online  products  and  services,  including  datacenter  costs  and 
royalties; warranty costs; inventory valuation adjustments; costs associated with the delivery of consulting services; and 
the amortization of capitalized software development costs. Capitalized software development costs  are  amortized over 
the estimated lives of the products.  

Product Warranty  

We  provide  for  the  estimated  costs  of  fulfilling  our  obligations  under  hardware  and  software  warranties  at  the  time  the 
related revenue is recognized. For hardware warranties, we estimate the costs based on historical and projected product 
failure  rates,  historical  and  projected  repair  costs,  and  knowledge  of  specific  product  failures  (if  any).  The  specific 
hardware warranty terms and conditions vary depending upon the product sold and the country in which we do business, 
but generally include parts and labor over a period generally ranging from 90 days to three years. For software warranties, 
we estimate the costs to provide bug fixes, such as security patches, over the estimated life of the software. We regularly 
reevaluate  our  estimates  to  assess  the  adequacy  of  the  recorded  warranty  liabilities  and  adjust  the  amounts  as 
necessary.  

Research and Development  

Research and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other 
headcount-related  expenses  associated  with  product  development.  Research  and  development  expenses  also  include 
third-party development and programming costs, localization costs incurred to translate software for international markets, 
and the amortization of purchased software code and services content. Such costs related to software development are 
included  in  research  and  development  expense  until  the  point  that  technological  feasibility  is  reached,  which  for  our 
software  products,  is  generally  shortly  before  the  products  are  released  to  production.  Once  technological  feasibility  is 
reached, such costs are capitalized and amortized to cost of revenue over the estimated lives of the products.  

Sales and Marketing  

Sales  and  marketing  expenses  include  payroll,  employee  benefits,  stock-based  compensation  expense,  and  other 
headcount-related  expenses  associated  with  sales  and  marketing  personnel,  and  the  costs  of  advertising,  promotions, 
trade  shows,  seminars,  and  other  programs.  Advertising  costs  are  expensed  as  incurred.  Advertising  expense  was 
$1.5 billion, $1.5 billion, and $1.6 billion in fiscal years 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.  

Stock-Based Compensation  

Compensation cost for stock awards, which include restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and performance stock units (“PSUs”), 
is measured at the fair value on the grant date and recognized as expense, net of estimated forfeitures, over the related 
service or performance period. The fair value of stock awards is based on the quoted price of our common stock on the 
grant date less the present value of expected dividends not received during the vesting period. We measure the fair value 
of PSUs using a Monte Carlo valuation model. Compensation cost for RSUs is recognized using the straight-line method 
and for PSUs is recognized using the accelerated method.  

Compensation  expense  for  the  employee  stock  purchase  plan  (“ESPP”)  is  measured  as  the  discount  the  employee  is 
entitled to upon purchase and is recognized in the period of purchase.  

Income Taxes  

Income tax expense includes U.S. and international income taxes, and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. 
Certain income and expenses are not reported in tax returns and financial statements in the same year. The tax effect of 
such  temporary  differences  is  reported  as  deferred  income  taxes.  Deferred  tax  assets  are  reported  net  of  a  valuation 
allowance when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. All deferred income taxes are classified as 
long-term in our consolidated balance sheets.  

56 

Financial Instruments  

Investments  

We consider all highly liquid interest-earning investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to 
be cash equivalents. The fair values of these investments approximate their carrying values. In general, investments with 
original maturities of greater than three months and remaining maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term 
investments.  Investments  with  maturities  beyond  one  year  may  be  classified  as  short-term  based  on  their  highly  liquid 
nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations.  

Debt  investments  are  classified  as  available-for-sale  and  realized  gains  and  losses  are  recorded  using  the  specific 
identification  method.  Changes  in  fair  value,  excluding  credit  losses  and  impairments,  are  recorded  in  other 
comprehensive  income.  Fair  value  is  calculated  based  on  publicly  available  market  information  or  other  estimates 
determined by management. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general 
market  conditions,  credit  quality  of  debt  instrument  issuers,  and  the  extent  to  which  the  fair  value  is  less  than  cost.  To 
determine  credit  losses,  we  employ  a  systematic  methodology  that  considers  available  quantitative  and  qualitative 
evidence. In addition, we consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of, and business outlook for, 
the investee. If we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security 
before recovery, then a decline in fair value below cost is recorded as an impairment charge in other income (expense), 
net and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we 
may incur future impairments.  

Equity  investments  with  readily  determinable  fair  values  are  measured  at  fair  value.  Equity  investments  without  readily 
determinable  fair  values  are  measured  using  the  equity  method  or  measured  at  cost  with  adjustments  for  observable 
changes in price or impairments (referred to as the measurement alternative). We perform a qualitative assessment on a 
periodic  basis and recognize an impairment if there  are  sufficient indicators that the  fair value of the investment  is less 
than carrying value. Changes in value are recorded in other income (expense), net.  

Derivatives  

Derivative  instruments  are  recognized  as  either  assets  or  liabilities  and  measured  at  fair  value.  The  accounting  for 
changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation.  

For derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, gains and losses are recognized in other income (expense), 
net  with  offsetting  gains  and  losses  on  the  hedged  items.  Gains  and  losses  representing  hedge  components  excluded 
from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in other income (expense), net.  

For  derivative  instruments  designated  as  cash  flow  hedges,  gains  and  losses  are  initially  reported  as  a  component  of 
other comprehensive income and subsequently recognized in other income (expense), net with the corresponding hedged 
item. Gains and losses representing hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in 
other income (expense), net.  

For derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges, gains and losses from changes in fair values are primarily 
recognized in other income (expense), net.  

Fair Value Measurements  

We account for certain assets and liabilities at fair value. The hierarchy below lists three levels of fair value based on the 
extent  to which inputs  used in  measuring  fair value are  observable in the market. We categorize each of our fair value 
measurements in one of these three levels based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement 
in its entirety. These levels are:  

• 

Level 1  –  inputs  are  based  upon  unadjusted  quoted  prices  for  identical  instruments  in  active  markets.  Our 
Level 1 investments include U.S. government securities, common and preferred stock, and mutual funds. Our 
Level 1 derivative assets and liabilities include those actively traded on exchanges.  

57 

  
• 

• 

Level 2  –  inputs  are  based  upon  quoted  prices  for  similar  instruments  in  active  markets,  quoted  prices  for 
identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques (e.g. the 
Black-Scholes model) for which all significant inputs are observable in the market or can be corroborated by 
observable  market  data  for  substantially  the  full  term  of  the  assets  or  liabilities.  Where  applicable,  these 
models  project  future  cash  flows  and  discount  the  future  amounts  to  a  present  value  using  market-based 
observable inputs including interest rate curves, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, and forward and spot 
prices for currencies. Our Level 2 investments include commercial paper, certificates of deposit, U.S. agency 
securities,  foreign  government  bonds,  mortgage-  and  asset-backed  securities,  corporate  notes  and  bonds, 
and municipal securities. Our Level 2 derivative assets and liabilities include certain over-the-counter forward, 
option, and swap contracts.  

Level 3 – inputs are generally unobservable and typically reflect management’s estimates of assumptions that 
market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The fair values are therefore determined using 
model-based  techniques,  including  option  pricing  models  and  discounted  cash  flow  models.  Our  Level 3 
assets  and  liabilities  include  investments  in  corporate  notes  and  bonds,  municipal  securities,  and  goodwill 
and  intangible  assets,  when  they  are  recorded  at  fair  value  due  to  an  impairment  charge. Unobservable 
inputs used in the models are significant to the fair values of the assets and liabilities.  

We measure equity investments without readily determinable fair values on a nonrecurring basis. The fair values of these 
investments are determined based on valuation techniques using the best information available, and may include quoted 
market prices, market comparables, and discounted cash flow projections.  

Inventories  

Inventories are stated at average cost, subject to the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost includes materials, labor, 
and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. Net realizable value is the estimated 
selling price less estimated costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. We regularly review inventory quantities on 
hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our inventory. If our review indicates a 
reduction in utility below carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost of revenue.  

Property and Equipment  

Property and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation, and depreciated using the straight-line method 
over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term. The estimated useful lives of our property and 
equipment  are  generally  as  follows:  computer  software  developed  or  acquired  for  internal  use,  three  to  seven  years; 
computer equipment, two to four years; buildings and improvements, five to 15 years; leasehold improvements, three to 
20 years; and furniture and equipment, one to 10 years. Land is not depreciated.  

Leases  

We  determine  if  an  arrangement  is  a  lease  at  inception.  Operating  leases  are  included  in  operating  lease  right-of-use 
(“ROU”) assets, other current liabilities, and operating lease liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. Finance leases 
are included in property and equipment, other current liabilities, and other long-term liabilities in our consolidated balance 
sheets.  

ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation 
to  make  lease  payments  arising  from  the  lease.  Operating  lease  ROU  assets  and  liabilities  are  recognized  at 
commencement date based on the present value of lease payments  over the lease term. As most of our leases do not 
provide  an  implicit  rate,  we  generally  use  our  incremental  borrowing  rate  based  on  the  estimated  rate  of  interest  for 
collateralized  borrowing  over  a  similar  term  of  the  lease  payments  at  commencement  date.  The  operating  lease  ROU 
asset  also  includes  any  lease  payments  made  and  excludes  lease  incentives.  Our  lease  terms  may  include  options  to 
extend  or  terminate  the  lease  when  it  is  reasonably  certain  that  we  will  exercise  that  option.  Lease  expense  for  lease 
payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.  

58 

  
We  have  lease  agreements  with  lease  and  non-lease  components,  which  are  generally  accounted  for  separately.  For 
certain  equipment  leases,  such  as  vehicles,  we  account  for  the  lease  and  non-lease  components  as  a  single  lease 
component.  Additionally,  for  certain  equipment  leases,  we  apply  a  portfolio  approach  to  effectively  account  for  the 
operating lease ROU assets and liabilities.  

Goodwill  

Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) 
on an annual basis (May 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more 
likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value.  

Intangible Assets  

Our  intangible  assets  are  subject  to  amortization  and  are  amortized  using  the  straight-line  method  over  their  estimated 
period of benefit, ranging from one to 20 years. We evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets periodically by taking 
into account events or circumstances that may warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate the asset may be 
impaired.  

Recent Accounting Guidance  

Accounting for Income Taxes  

In  December  2019,  the  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board  issued  a  new  standard  to  simplify  the  accounting  for 
income  taxes.  The  guidance  eliminates  certain  exceptions  related  to  the  approach  for  intraperiod  tax  allocation,  the 
methodology  for  calculating  income  taxes  in  an  interim  period,  and  the  recognition  of  deferred  tax  liabilities  for  outside 
basis differences related to changes in ownership of equity method investments and foreign subsidiaries. The guidance 
also  simplifies  aspects  of  accounting  for  franchise  taxes  and  enacted  changes  in  tax  laws  or  rates  and  clarifies  the 
accounting for transactions that result in a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill. We adopted the standard effective July 1, 
2021. Adoption of the standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.  

NOTE 2 — EARNINGS PER SHARE  

Basic  earnings  per  share  (“EPS”)  is  computed  based  on  the  weighted  average  number  of  shares  of  common  stock 
outstanding  during  the  period.  Diluted  EPS  is  computed  based  on  the  weighted  average  number  of  shares  of  common 
stock plus the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method. 
Dilutive potential common shares include outstanding stock options and stock awards.  

The components of basic and diluted EPS were as follows:

(a)  Refer to Note 5 – Derivatives for further information on the fair value of our derivative instruments.  

Equity investments presented as “Other” in the tables above include investments without readily determinable fair values 
measured using the equity method or measured at cost with adjustments for observable changes in price or impairments, 
and investments measured at fair value using net asset value as a practical expedient which are not categorized in the fair 
value hierarchy. As of June 30, 2022 and 2021, equity investments without readily determinable fair values measured at 
cost with adjustments for observable changes in price or impairments were $3.8 billion and $3.3 billion, respectively.

NOTE 5 — DERIVATIVES  

We use derivative instruments to manage risks  related to foreign currencies, interest  rates, equity prices, and credit; to 
enhance  investment  returns;  and  to  facilitate  portfolio  diversification.  Our  objectives  for  holding  derivatives  include 
reducing,  eliminating,  and  efficiently  managing  the  economic  impact  of  these  exposures  as  effectively  as  possible.  Our 
derivative programs include strategies that both qualify and do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment.  

Foreign Currencies  

Certain  forecasted  transactions,  assets,  and  liabilities  are  exposed  to  foreign  currency  risk.  We  monitor  our  foreign 
currency exposures daily to maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions.  

Foreign  currency  risks  related  to  certain  non-U.S.  dollar-denominated  investments  are  hedged  using  foreign  exchange 
forward contracts that  are designated as fair value hedging instruments. Foreign currency risks  related to certain Euro-
denominated  debt  are  hedged  using  foreign  exchange  forward  contracts  that  are  designated  as  cash  flow  hedging 
instruments.  

Certain  options  and  forwards  not  designated  as  hedging  instruments  are  also  used  to  manage  the  variability  in  foreign 
exchange rates on certain balance sheet amounts and to manage other foreign currency exposures.  

Interest Rate  

Interest rate risks related to certain fixed-rate debt are hedged using interest rate swaps that are designated as fair value 
hedging instruments to effectively convert the fixed interest rates to floating interest rates.

Securities  held  in  our  fixed-income  portfolio  are  subject  to  different  interest  rate  risks  based  on  their  maturities.  We 
manage  the  average  maturity  of  our  fixed-income  portfolio  to  achieve  economic  returns  that  correlate  to  certain  broad-
based  fixed-income  indices  using  exchange-traded  option  and  futures  contracts  and  over-the-counter  swap  and  option 
contracts. These contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and are included in “Other contracts” in the tables 
below.  

Equity  

Securities held in our equity investments portfolio are subject to market price risk. At times, we may hold options, futures, 
and swap contracts. These contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and are included in “Other contracts” in 
the tables below.  

Credit  

Our fixed-income portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of investment-grade securities. We use credit default swap 
contracts  to  manage  credit  exposures  relative  to  broad-based  indices  and  to  facilitate  portfolio  diversification.  These 
contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and are included in “Other contracts” in the tables below.  

Credit-Risk-Related Contingent Features  

Certain  of  our  counterparty  agreements  for  derivative  instruments  contain  provisions  that  require  our  issued  and 
outstanding long-term unsecured debt to maintain an investment grade credit rating and require us to maintain minimum 
liquidity of $1.0 billion. To the extent we fail to meet these requirements, we will be required to post collateral, similar to 
the standard convention related to over-the-counter derivatives. As of June 30, 2022, our long-term unsecured debt rating 
was AAA, and cash investments were in excess of $1.0 billion. As a result, no collateral was required to be posted.

Nuance Communications, Inc.  

NOTE 8 — BUSINESS COMBINATIONS  

On March 4, 2022, we completed our acquisition of Nuance Communications, Inc. (“Nuance”) for a total purchase price of 
$18.8 billion,  consisting  primarily  of  cash.  Nuance  is  a  cloud  and  artificial  intelligence  (“AI”)  software  provider  with 
healthcare  and  enterprise  AI  experience,  and  the  acquisition  will  build  on  our  industry-specific  cloud  offerings.  The 
financial results of Nuance have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the date of the acquisition. 
Nuance is reported as part of our Intelligent Cloud segment.  

The purchase price allocation as of the date of acquisition was based on a preliminary valuation and is subject to revision

Activision Blizzard, Inc.  

On January 18, 2022, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Activision Blizzard, Inc. (“Activision Blizzard”) for 
$95.00 per share in  an  all-cash transaction valued at $68.7 billion, inclusive of Activision Blizzard’s net cash. Activision 
Blizzard  is  a  leader  in  game  development  and  an  interactive  entertainment  content  publisher.  The  acquisition  will 
accelerate the growth in our gaming business across mobile, PC, console, and cloud and will provide building blocks for 
the  metaverse.  The  acquisition  has  been  approved  by  Activision  Blizzard’s  shareholders,  and  we  expect  it  to  close  in 
fiscal year 2023, subject to the satisfaction of certain regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.  

Changes in the carrying amount of goodwill were as follows:

Includes goodwill of $16.3 billion related to Nuance. See Note 8 – Business Combinations for further information.  

The measurement periods for the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed end as soon as information on the 
facts  and  circumstances  that  existed  as  of  the  acquisition  dates  becomes  available,  but  do  not  exceed  12  months. 
Adjustments in purchase price allocations may require a change in the amounts allocated to goodwill during the periods in 
which the adjustments are determined.  

Any  change  in  the  goodwill  amounts  resulting  from  foreign  currency  translations  and  purchase  accounting  adjustments 
are  presented  as  “Other”  in  the  table  above.  Also  included  in  “Other”  are  business  dispositions  and  transfers  between 
segments due to reorganizations, as applicable.  

Goodwill Impairment  

We  test  goodwill  for  impairment  annually  on  May 1  at  the  reporting  unit  level,  primarily  using  a  discounted  cash  flow 
methodology with a peer-based, risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital. We believe use of a discounted cash flow 
approach is the most reliable indicator of the fair values of the businesses.  

No instances of impairment were identified in our May 1, 2022, May 1, 2021, or May 1, 2020 tests. As of June 30, 2022 
and 2021, accumulated goodwill impairment was $11.3 billion.

In the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, we transferred certain intangible properties from our Puerto Rico subsidiary to the 
U.S. The transfer of intangible properties resulted in a $3.3 billion net income tax benefit in the first quarter of fiscal year 
2022, as the value of future U.S. tax deductions exceeds the current tax liability from the U.S. global intangible low-taxed 
income (“GILTI”) tax.  

We  have  historically  paid  India  withholding  taxes  on  software  sales  through  distributor  withholding  and  tax  audit 
assessments in India. In March 2021, the India Supreme Court ruled favorably in the case of Engineering Analysis Centre 
of Excellence Private Limited vs  The Commissioner of Income Tax for companies in 86 separate appeals, some dating 
back to 2012, holding that software sales are not subject to India withholding taxes. Although we were not a party to the 
appeals, our software sales in India were determined to be not subject to withholding taxes. Therefore, we recorded a net 
income tax benefit of $620 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2021 to reflect the results of the India Supreme Court 
decision impacting fiscal year 1996 through fiscal year 2016.  

The decrease from the federal statutory rate in fiscal year 2022 is primarily due to the net income tax benefit related to the 
transfer  of  intangible  properties,  earnings  taxed  at  lower  rates  in  foreign  jurisdictions  resulting  from  producing  and 
distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations center in Ireland, and tax benefits relating to 
stock-based compensation. The decrease from the federal statutory rate in fiscal year 2021 is primarily due to earnings 
taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our 
foreign regional operations centers in Ireland and Puerto Rico, tax benefits relating to stock-based compensation, and tax 
benefits from the India Supreme Court decision on withholding taxes. The decrease from the federal statutory rate in fiscal 
year 2020 is primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing 
our  products  and  services  through  our  foreign  regional  operations  centers  in  Ireland  and  Puerto  Rico,  and  tax  benefits 
relating  to  stock-based  compensation.  In  fiscal  years  2022,  2021,  and  2020,  our  foreign  regional  operating  centers  in 
Ireland and Puerto Rico, which are taxed at rates lower than the U.S. rate, generated 71%, 82%, and 86% of our foreign 
income before tax. Other reconciling items, net

decision on withholding taxes. In fiscal years 2022, 2021, and 2020, there were no individually significant other reconciling 
items.  

The decrease in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021 was primarily due to a $3.3 billion 
net income tax benefit in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 related to the transfer of intangible properties, offset in part by 
changes in the mix of our income before income taxes between the U.S. and foreign countries, as well as tax benefits in 
the prior year from the India Supreme Court decision on withholding taxes, an agreement between the U.S. and India tax 
authorities related to transfer pricing, and final Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”) regulations. The decrease in our effective 
tax rate for fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020 was primarily due to tax benefits from the India Supreme Court 
decision on withholding taxes,  an agreement  between the U.S. and India tax authorities  related to transfer pricing, final 
TCJA regulations, and an increase in tax benefits relating to stock-based compensation.

Deferred  income  tax  balances  reflect  the  effects  of  temporary  differences  between  the  carrying  amounts  of  assets  and 
liabilities  and  their  tax  bases  and  are  stated  at  enacted  tax  rates  expected  to  be  in  effect  when  the  taxes  are  paid  or 
recovered.  

As of June 30, 2022, we had federal, state, and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $318 million, $1.3 billion, and 
$2.1 billion,  respectively.  The  federal  and  state  net  operating  loss  carryforwards  will  expire  in  various  years  from  fiscal 
2023  through  2042,  if  not  utilized.  The  majority  of  our  foreign  net  operating  loss  carryforwards  do  not  expire.  Certain 
acquired net operating loss carryforwards are subject to an annual limitation but are expected to be realized

with the exception of those which have a valuation allowance. As of June 30, 2022, we had $1.3 billion federal capital loss 
carryforwards for U.S. tax purposes from our acquisition of Nuance. The federal capital loss carryforwards are subject to 
an annual limitation and will expire in various years from fiscal 2023 through 2025.  

The  valuation  allowance  disclosed  in  the  table  above  relates  to  the  foreign  net  operating  loss  carryforwards,  federal 
capital loss carryforwards, and other net deferred tax assets that may not be realized.  

Income taxes paid, net of refunds, were $16.0 billion, $13.4 billion, and $12.5 billion in fiscal years 2022, 2021, and 2020, 
respectively.  

Uncertain Tax Positions  

Gross  unrecognized  tax  benefits  related  to  uncertain  tax  positions  as  of  June 30,  2022,  2021,  and  2020,  were 
$15.6 billion, $14.6 billion, and $13.8 billion, respectively, which were primarily included in long-term income taxes in our 
consolidated  balance  sheets.  If  recognized,  the  resulting  tax  benefit  would  affect  our  effective  tax  rates  for  fiscal  years 
2022, 2021, and 2020 by $13.3 billion, $12.5 billion, and $12.1 billion, respectively.  

As of June 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020, we had accrued interest expense related to uncertain tax positions of $4.3 billion, 
$4.3 billion, and $4.0 billion, respectively, net of income tax benefits. The provision for income taxes for fiscal years 2022, 
2021, and 2020 included interest expense related to uncertain tax positions of $36 million, $274 million, and $579 million, 
respectively, net of income tax benefits.

We  settled  a  portion  of  the  Internal  Revenue  Service  (“IRS”)  audit  for  tax  years  2004  to  2006  in  fiscal  year  2011.  In 
February 2012, the IRS withdrew its 2011 Revenue Agents Report related to unresolved issues for tax years 2004 to 2006 
and reopened the audit phase of the examination. We also settled a portion of the IRS audit for tax years 2007 to 2009 in 
fiscal year 2016, and a portion of the IRS audit for tax years 2010 to 2013 in fiscal year 2018. In the second quarter of 
fiscal year 2021, we settled an  additional portion  of the  IRS audits for tax years 2004 to 2013 and made  a payment of 
$1.7 billion, including tax and interest. We remain under audit for tax years 2004 to 2017.  

As  of  June 30,  2022,  the  primary  unresolved  issues  for  the  IRS  audits  relate  to  transfer  pricing,  which  could  have  a 
material  impact  in  our  consolidated  financial  statements  when  the  matters  are  resolved.  We  believe  our  allowances  for 
income tax contingencies are adequate. We have not received a proposed assessment  for  the  unresolved key transfer 
pricing  issues  and  do  not  expect  a  final  resolution  of  these  issues  in  the  next  12  months. Based  on  the  information 
currently available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our tax contingencies for these issues within 
the next 12 months.  

We are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U.S. Our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject 
to examination for tax years 1996 to 2021, some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. The resolution 
of each of these audits is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements.

NOTE 14 — LEASES  

We have operating and finance leases for datacenters,  corporate offices, research and development facilities, Microsoft 
Experience Centers, and certain equipment. Our leases have remaining lease terms of 1 year to 19 years, some of which

Antitrust Litigation and Claims  

China State Administration for Market Regulation Investigation  

NOTE 15 — CONTINGENCIES  

In 2014, Microsoft was informed that China’s State Agency for Market Regulation (“SAMR”) (formerly State Administration 
for  Industry  and  Commerce)  had  begun  a  formal  investigation  relating  to  China’s  Anti-Monopoly  Law,  and  the  SAMR 
conducted  onsite  inspections  of  Microsoft  offices  in  Beijing,  Shanghai,  Guangzhou,  and  Chengdu.  In  2019,  the  SAMR 
presented preliminary views as to certain possible violations of China’s Anti-Monopoly Law.  

Product-Related Litigation  

U.S. Cell Phone Litigation  

Microsoft  Mobile  Oy,  a  subsidiary  of  Microsoft,  along  with  other  handset  manufacturers  and  network  operators,  is  a 
defendant in 46 lawsuits, including 45 lawsuits filed in the Superior Court for the District of Columbia by individual plaintiffs 
who allege that radio  emissions  from cellular handsets  caused their brain tumors  and other adverse health effects. We 
assumed  responsibility  for  these  claims  in  our  agreement  to  acquire  Nokia’s  Devices  and  Services  business  and  have 
been substituted for the Nokia defendants. Nine of these cases were filed in 2002 and are consolidated for certain pre-trial 
proceedings;  the  remaining  cases  are  stayed.  In  a  separate  2009  decision,  the  Court  of  Appeals  for  the  District  of 
Columbia  held  that  adverse  health  effect  claims  arising  from  the  use  of  cellular  handsets  that  operate  within  the  U.S. 
Federal Communications Commission radio frequency emission guidelines (“FCC Guidelines”) are pre-empted by federal 
law. The plaintiffs allege that their handsets either operated outside the FCC Guidelines or were manufactured before the 
FCC  Guidelines  went  into  effect.  The  lawsuits  also  allege  an  industry-wide  conspiracy  to  manipulate  the  science  and 
testing around emission guidelines.  

In 2013, the defendants in the consolidated cases moved to exclude the plaintiffs’ expert evidence of general causation on 
the  basis  of  flawed  scientific  methodologies.  In  2014,  the  trial  court  granted  in  part  and  denied  in  part  the  defendants’ 
motion to exclude the plaintiffs’ general causation experts. The defendants filed an interlocutory appeal to the District of 
Columbia Court of Appeals challenging the standard for evaluating expert scientific evidence. In October 2016, the Court 
of Appeals issued its decision adopting the standard advocated by the defendants and remanding the cases to  the trial 
court for further proceedings under that standard. The plaintiffs have filed supplemental expert evidence, portions of which 
the  defendants  have  moved  to  strike.  In  August  2018,  the  trial  court  issued  an  order  striking  portions  of  the  plaintiffs’ 
expert reports. A hearing on general causation is scheduled for September of 2022.  

Other Contingencies  

We  also  are  subject  to  a  variety  of  other  claims  and  suits  that  arise  from  time  to  time  in  the  ordinary  course  of  our 
business. Although management currently believes that resolving claims against us, individually or in aggregate, will not 
have  a  material  adverse  impact  in  our  consolidated  financial  statements,  these  matters  are  subject  to  inherent 
uncertainties and management’s view of these matters may change in the future.  

As  of  June 30,  2022,  we  accrued  aggregate  legal  liabilities  of  $364 million.  While  we  intend  to  defend  these  matters 
vigorously,  adverse  outcomes  that  we  estimate  could  reach  approximately  $600 million  in  aggregate  beyond  recorded 
amounts  are  reasonably  possible.  Were  unfavorable  final  outcomes  to  occur,  there  exists  the  possibility  of  a  material 
adverse impact in our consolidated financial statements for the period in which the effects become reasonably estimable.

NOTE 18 — EMPLOYEE STOCK AND SAVINGS PLANS  

We grant stock-based compensation to employees and directors. Awards that expire or are canceled without delivery of 
shares  generally  become  available  for  issuance  under  the  plans.  We  issue  new  shares  of  Microsoft  common  stock  to 
satisfy vesting of awards granted under our stock plans. We also have an ESPP for all eligible employees.  

Stock-based compensation expense and related income tax benefits were as follows:

Stock awards entitle the holder to receive shares of Microsoft common stock as the award vests. Stock awards generally 
vest over a service period of four years or five years.  

Executive Incentive Plan  

Under  the  Executive  Incentive  Plan,  the  Compensation  Committee  approves  stock  awards  to  executive  officers  and 
certain  senior  executives.  RSUs  generally  vest  ratably  over  a  service  period  of  four  years.  PSUs  generally  vest  over  a 
performance period of three years. The number of shares the PSU holder receives is based on the extent to which the 
corresponding performance goals have been achieved.  

Activity for All Stock Plans  

The fair value of stock awards was estimated on the date of grant using the following assumptions:

As  of  June 30,  2022,  there  was  approximately  $16.7 billion  of  total  unrecognized  compensation  costs  related  to  stock 
awards.  These  costs  are  expected  to  be  recognized  over  a  weighted  average  period  of  three  years.  The  weighted 
average grant-date fair value  of stock awards granted was $291.22, $221.13, and $140.49 for fiscal years  2022, 2021, 
and 2020, respectively. The fair value of stock awards vested was $14.1 billion, $13.4 billion, and $10.1 billion, for fiscal 
years 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. As of June 30, 2022, an aggregate of 211 million shares were authorized for 
future grant under our stock plans.  

Employee Stock Purchase Plan  

We  have  an  ESPP  for  all  eligible  employees.  Shares  of  our  common  stock  may  be  purchased  by  employees  at  three-
month  intervals  at  90%  of  the  fair  market  value  on  the  last  trading  day  of  each  three-month  period.  Employees  may 
purchase  shares  having  a  value  not  exceeding  15%  of  their  gross  compensation  during  an  offering  period.  Under  the 
terms of the ESPP that were approved in 2012, the plan was set to terminate on December 31, 2022. At our 2021 Annual 
Shareholders Meeting, our shareholders approved a successor ESPP with a January 1, 2022 effective date and ten-year 
expiration of December 31, 2031. No additional shares were requested at this meeting.  

Employees purchased the following shares during the periods presented:

Savings Plans  

We  have  savings  plans  in  the  U.S.  that  qualify  under  Section 401(k)  of  the  Internal  Revenue  Code,  and  a  number  of 
savings plans in international locations. Eligible U.S. employees may contribute a portion of their salary into the savings 
plans, subject to certain limitations. We match a portion of each dollar a participant contributes into the plans. Employer-
funded retirement benefits for all plans were $1.4 billion, $1.2 billion, and $1.0 billion in fiscal years 2022, 2021, and 2020, 
respectively, and were expensed as contributed.

NOTE 19 — SEGMENT INFORMATION AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA  

In  its  operation  of  the  business,  management,  including  our  chief  operating  decision  maker,  who  is  also  our  Chief 
Executive Officer, reviews certain financial information, including segmented internal profit and loss statements prepared 
on a basis not consistent with GAAP. During the periods presented, we reported our financial performance based on the 
following segments: Productivity and Business Processes, Intelligent Cloud, and More Personal Computing.  

Our reportable segments are described below.  

Productivity and Business Processes  

Our  Productivity  and  Business  Processes  segment  consists  of  products  and  services  in  our  portfolio  of  productivity, 
communication, and information services, spanning a variety of devices and platforms. This segment primarily comprises:  

•  Office  Commercial  (Office  365  subscriptions,  the  Office  365  portion  of  Microsoft  365  Commercial 
subscriptions, and Office licensed on-premises), comprising Office, Exchange, SharePoint, Microsoft Teams, 
Office 365 Security and Compliance, and Microsoft Viva.  

•  Office  Consumer,  including  Microsoft  365  Consumer  subscriptions,  Office  licensed  on-premises,  and  other 

Office services.  

• 

LinkedIn, including Talent Solutions, Marketing Solutions, Premium Subscriptions, and Sales Solutions.  

•  Dynamics  business  solutions,  including  Dynamics  365,  comprising  a  set  of  intelligent,  cloud-based 
applications across ERP, CRM, Customer Insights, Power Apps, and Power Automate; and on-premises ERP 
and CRM applications.  

Intelligent Cloud  

Our  Intelligent  Cloud  segment  consists  of  our  public,  private,  and  hybrid  server  products  and  cloud  services  that  can 
power modern business and developers. This segment primarily comprises:  

•  Server products and cloud services, including Azure and other cloud services; SQL Server, Windows Server, 

Visual Studio, System Center, and related Client Access Licenses (“CALs”); and Nuance and GitHub.  

•  Enterprise  Services,  including  Enterprise  Support  Services,  Microsoft  Consulting  Services,  and  Nuance 

professional services.  

More Personal Computing  

Our  More  Personal  Computing  segment  consists  of  products  and  services  that  put  customers  at  the  center  of  the 
experience with our technology. This segment primarily comprises:  

•  Windows,  including  Windows  OEM  licensing  and  other  non-volume  licensing  of  the  Windows  operating 
system;  Windows  Commercial,  comprising  volume  licensing  of  the  Windows  operating  system,  Windows 
cloud services, and other Windows commercial offerings; patent licensing; and Windows Internet of Things.  

•  Devices, including Surface and PC accessories.  

•  Gaming,  including  Xbox  hardware  and  Xbox  content  and  services,  comprising  first-  and  third-party  content 
(including  games  and  in-game  content),  Xbox  Game  Pass  and  other  subscriptions,  Xbox  Cloud  Gaming, 
third-party disc royalties, advertising, and other cloud services.  

•  Search and news advertising.  

Revenue  and  costs  are  generally  directly  attributed  to  our  segments.  However,  due  to  the  integrated  structure  of  our 
business,  certain  revenue  recognized  and  costs  incurred  by  one  segment  may  benefit  other  segments.  Revenue  from 
certain contracts is allocated among the segments based on the relative value of the underlying products and services, 
which can include allocation based on actual prices charged, prices when sold separately, or estimated costs plus a profit 
margin. Cost of revenue is allocated in certain cases based on a relative revenue methodology. Operating expenses that 
are allocated primarily include those relating to marketing of products and services from which multiple segments benefit 
and are generally allocated based on relative gross margin.  

81 

  
In addition, certain costs incurred at a corporate level that are identifiable and that benefit our segments are allocated to 
them.  These  allocated  costs  include  legal,  including  settlements  and  fines,  information  technology,  human  resources, 
finance,  excise  taxes,  field  selling,  shared  facilities  services,  and  customer  service  and  support.  Each  allocation  is 
measured differently based on the specific facts and circumstances of the costs being allocated.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM  

To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Microsoft Corporation  

Opinion on the Financial Statements  

We  have  audited  the  accompanying  consolidated  balance  sheets  of  Microsoft  Corporation  and  subsidiaries  (the 
“Company”) as of June 30, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, cash 
flows,  and  stockholders’  equity,  for  each  of  the  three  years  in  the  period  ended  June  30,  2022,  and  the  related  notes 
(collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material 
respects, the financial position of the Company as  of June 30, 2022  and 2021,  and the results of its operations  and its 
cash  flows  for  each  of  the  three  years  in  the  period  ended  June  30,  2022,  in  conformity  with  accounting  principles 
generally accepted in the United States of America.  

We  have  also  audited,  in  accordance  with  the  standards  of  the  Public  Company  Accounting  Oversight  Board  (United 
States)  (PCAOB),  the  Company’s  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  as  of  June  30,  2022,  based  on  criteria 
established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of 
the  Treadway  Commission  and  our  report  dated  July  28,  2022,  expressed  an  unqualified  opinion  on  the  Company’s 
internal control over financial reporting.  

Basis for Opinion  

These  financial  statements  are  the  responsibility  of  the  Company’s  management.  Our  responsibility  is  to  express  an 
opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the 
PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities 
laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.  

We  conducted  our  audits  in  accordance  with  the  standards  of  the  PCAOB.  Those  standards  require  that  we  plan  and 
perform  the  audit  to  obtain  reasonable  assurance  about  whether  the  financial  statements  are  free  of  material 
misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our  audits included performing  procedures to assess  the  risks of  material 
misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those 
risks.  Such  procedures  included  examining,  on  a  test  basis,  evidence  regarding  the  amounts  and  disclosures  in  the 
financial statements. Our audits  also included  evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made 
by  management,  as  well  as  evaluating  the  overall  presentation  of  the  financial  statements.  We  believe  that  our  audits 
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.  

Critical Audit Matters  

The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements 
that  were  communicated  or  required  to  be  communicated  to  the  audit  committee  and  that  (1)  relate  to  accounts  or 
disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex 
judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, 
taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the 
critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.

Revenue Recognition – Refer to Note 1 to the financial statements  

Critical Audit Matter Description  

The Company recognizes revenue upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount 
that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for those products or services. The Company 
offers customers the ability to acquire multiple licenses of software products and services, including cloud-based services, 
in its customer agreements through its volume licensing programs.  

Significant  judgment  is  exercised  by  the  Company  in  determining  revenue  recognition  for  these  customer  agreements, 
and includes the following:  

•  Determination  of  whether  products  and  services  are  considered  distinct  performance  obligations  that  should  be 
accounted  for  separately  versus  together,  such  as  software  licenses  and  related  services  that  are  sold  with  cloud-
based services.  

•  The pattern of delivery (i.e., timing of when revenue is recognized) for each distinct performance obligation.  

• 

Identification  and  treatment  of  contract  terms  that  may  impact  the  timing  and  amount  of  revenue  recognized  (e.g., 
variable consideration, optional purchases, and free services).  

•  Determination of stand-alone selling prices for each distinct performance obligation and for products and services that 

are not sold separately.  

Given these factors and due to the volume of transactions, the related audit effort in evaluating management’s judgments 
in determining revenue recognition for these customer agreements was extensive and required a high degree of auditor 
judgment.  

How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit  

Our principal audit procedures related to the Company’s revenue recognition for these customer agreements included the 
following:  

•  We  tested  the  effectiveness  of  controls  related  to  the  identification  of  distinct  performance  obligations,  the 

determination of the timing of revenue recognition, and the estimation of variable consideration.  

•  We  evaluated  management’s  significant  accounting  policies  related 

to 

these  customer  agreements 

for 

reasonableness.  

•  We selected a sample of customer agreements and performed the following procedures:  

-  Obtained and read contract source documents for each selection, including master agreements, and other documents 

that were part of the agreement.  

- 

Tested management’s identification and treatment of contract terms.  

-  Assessed the terms in the customer agreement and  evaluated the appropriateness of management’s application of 
their accounting policies, along with their use of estimates, in the determination of revenue recognition conclusions.  

•  We evaluated the reasonableness of management’s estimate of stand-alone selling prices for products and services 

that are not sold separately.  

•  We tested the mathematical accuracy of management’s calculations of revenue and the associated timing of revenue 

recognized in the financial statements.

Income Taxes — Uncertain Tax Positions — Refer to Note 12 to the financial statements  

Critical Audit Matter Description  

The  Company’s  long-term  income  taxes  liability  includes  uncertain  tax  positions  related  to  transfer  pricing  issues  that 
remain unresolved with the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”). The Company remains under IRS audit, or subject to IRS 
audit,  for  tax  years  subsequent  to  2003.  While  the  Company  has  settled  a  portion  of  the  IRS  audits,  resolution  of  the 
remaining matters could have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements.  

Conclusions  on  recognizing  and  measuring  uncertain  tax  positions  involve  significant  estimates  and  management 
judgment and include complex considerations of the Internal Revenue Code, related regulations, tax case laws, and prior-
year  audit  settlements.  Given  the  complexity  and  the  subjective  nature  of  the  transfer  pricing  issues  that  remain 
unresolved  with  the  IRS,  evaluating  management’s  estimates  relating  to  their  determination  of  uncertain  tax  positions 
required extensive audit effort and a high degree of auditor judgment, including involvement of our tax specialists.  

How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit  

Our  principal  audit  procedures  to  evaluate  management’s  estimates  of  uncertain  tax  positions  related  to  unresolved 
transfer pricing issues included the following:  

•  We  evaluated  the  appropriateness  and  consistency  of  management’s  methods  and  assumptions  used  in  the 
identification,  recognition,  measurement,  and  disclosure  of  uncertain  tax  positions,  which  included  testing  the 
effectiveness of the related internal controls.  

•  We  read  and  evaluated  management’s  documentation,  including  relevant  accounting  policies  and  information 

obtained by management from outside tax specialists, that detailed the basis of the uncertain tax positions.  

•  We  tested  the  reasonableness  of  management’s  judgments  regarding  the  future  resolution  of  the  uncertain  tax 

positions, including an evaluation of the technical merits of the uncertain tax positions.  

•  For  those  uncertain  tax  positions  that  had  not  been  effectively  settled,  we  evaluated  whether  management  had 
appropriately considered new information that could significantly change the recognition, measurement or disclosure 
of the uncertain tax positions.  

•  We  evaluated  the  reasonableness  of  management’s  estimates  by  considering  how  tax  law,  including  statutes, 

regulations and case law, impacted management’s judgments.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  

Under  the  supervision  and  with  the  participation  of  our  management,  including  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  Chief 
Financial Officer, we have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as required by Exchange 
Act  Rule  13a-15(b)  as  of  the  end  of  the  period  covered  by  this  report.  Based  on  that  evaluation,  the  Chief  Executive 
Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures are effective.  

REPORT OF MANAGEMENT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING  

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the 
Company. Internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of 
our  financial  reporting  for  external  purposes  in  accordance  with  accounting  principles  generally  accepted  in  the  United 
States  of  America.  Internal  control  over  financial  reporting  includes  maintaining  records  that  in  reasonable  detail 
accurately and fairly reflect our transactions; providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary 
for preparation of our consolidated financial statements; providing reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures of 
company  assets  are  made  in  accordance  with  management  authorization;  and  providing  reasonable  assurance  that 
unauthorized  acquisition,  use,  or  disposition  of  company  assets  that  could  have  a  material  effect  on  our  consolidated 
financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control 
over  financial  reporting  is  not  intended  to  provide  absolute  assurance  that  a  misstatement  of  our  consolidated  financial 
statements would be prevented or detected.  

Management  conducted  an  evaluation  of  the  effectiveness  of  our  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  based  on  the 
framework in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the 
Treadway  Commission.  Based  on  this  evaluation,  management  concluded  that  the  Company’s  internal  control  over 
financial  reporting  was  effective  as  of  June 30,  2022.  There  were  no  changes  in  our  internal  control  over  financial 
reporting  during  the  quarter  ended  June 30,  2022  that  have  materially  affected,  or  are  reasonably  likely  to  materially 
affect, our internal control  over financial reporting. Deloitte & Touche LLP has audited our internal control over financial 
reporting as of June 30, 2022; their report follows.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM  

To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Microsoft Corporation  

Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting  

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Microsoft Corporation and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as 
of  June  30,  2022,  based  on  criteria  established  in  Internal  Control—Integrated  Framework  (2013)  issued  by  the 
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, 
in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2022, based on criteria established 
in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.  

We  have  also  audited,  in  accordance  with  the  standards  of  the  Public  Company  Accounting  Oversight  Board  (United 
States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended June 30, 2022, of the Company and 
our report dated July 28, 2022, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.  

Basis for Opinion  

The  Company’s  management  is  responsible  for  maintaining  effective  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  and  for  its 
assessment  of  the  effectiveness  of  internal  control  over  financial  reporting,  included  in  the  accompanying  Report  of 
Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s 
internal control over financial reporting based on  our audit. We are a public accounting firm  registered with the PCAOB 
and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and 
the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.  

We  conducted  our  audit  in  accordance  with  the  standards  of  the  PCAOB.  Those  standards  require  that  we  plan  and 
perform  the  audit  to  obtain  reasonable  assurance  about  whether  effective  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  was 
maintained  in  all  material  respects.  Our  audit  included  obtaining  an  understanding  of  internal  control  over  financial 
reporting,  assessing  the  risk  that  a  material  weakness  exists,  testing  and  evaluating  the  design  and  operating 
effectiveness  of  internal  control  based  on  the  assessed  risk,  and  performing  such  other  procedures  as  we  considered 
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.  

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting  

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the 
reliability  of  financial  reporting  and  the  preparation  of  financial  statements  for  external  purposes  in  accordance  with 
generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and 
procedures  that  (1)  pertain  to  the  maintenance  of  records  that,  in  reasonable  detail,  accurately  and  fairly  reflect  the 
transactions  and  dispositions  of  the  assets  of  the  company;  (2)  provide  reasonable  assurance  that  transactions  are 
recorded  as  necessary  to  permit  preparation  of  financial  statements  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting 
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of 
management  and  directors  of  the  company;  and  (3)  provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  prevention  or  timely 
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the 
financial statements.  

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, 
projections  of  any  evaluation  of  effectiveness  to  future  periods  are  subject  to  the  risk  that  controls  may  become 
inadequate  because  of  changes  in  conditions,  or  that  the  degree  of  compliance  with  the  policies  or  procedures  may 
deteriorate.
